        *** JB's Discoveries for the next agent to implement ***

        The goal is to reverse-engineer the site's API to get a list of all tracks
        for a given day, then get the race card for each track, and finally the
        runner data for each race.

        1.  **Main Page (potential source for a list of all tracks):**
            - https://www.twinspires.com/bet/todays-races/

        2.  **Example Track URLs (these seem to load the race card data):**
            - Greyhound: https://www.twinspires.com/adw/todays-tracks/cp1/Greyhound/races?affid=0
            - Thoroughbred: https://www.twinspires.com/adw/todays-tracks/fl/Thoroughbred/races?affid=0
            - Harness: https://www.twinspires.com/adw/todays-tracks/mr/Harness/races?affid=0

        3.  **Example Race Card JSON (for Central Park):**
            This data is likely fetched by one of the track URLs above. Note that this
            JSON does NOT contain the runner (horse/greyhound) data, so another API
            call will be needed to get the entries for each race.
