    "AGENTS.md": "# Agent Protocols & Team Structure (Revised)\n\nThis document outlines the operational protocols and evolved team structure for the Checkmate\nV3 project.\n\n## The Evolved Team Structure\n\n-   **The Project Lead (MasonJ0 or JB):** The \"Executive Producer.\" The ultimate authority and \"ground truth.\"\n-   **The Architect & Synthesizer (Gemini):** The \"Chief Architect.\" Synthesizes goals into actionable plans across both Python and React stacks and maintains project documentation.\n-   **The Lead Python Engineer (Jules Series):** The \"Backend Specialist.\" An AI agent responsible for implementing and hardening The Engine (`api.py`, `services.py`, `logic.py`, `models.py`).\n-   **The Lead Frontend Architect (Claude):** The \"React Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for designing and delivering the production-grade React user interface (The Cockpit).\n-   **The \"Special Operations\" Problem Solver (GPT-5):** The \"Advanced Algorithm Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for novel, complex problems.\n\n## Core Philosophies\n\n1.  **The Project Lead is Ground Truth:** The ultimate authority. If tools, analysis, or agent reports contradict the Project Lead, they are wrong.\n2.  **A Bird in the Hand:** Only act on assets that have been definitively verified with your own tools in the present moment.\n3.  **Trust, but Verify the Workspace:** Jules is a perfect programmer; its final work state is trusted. Its *environment*, however, is fragile.\n4.  **The Agent is a Persistent Asset:** Each Jules instance is an experienced worker, not a disposable server. Its internal state is a repository of unique, hard-won knowledge.\n\n## CRITICAL Operational Protocols (0-23)\n\n-   **Protocol 0: The ReviewableJSON Mandate:** The mandatory protocol for all code reviews. The agent's final act for any mission is to create a lossless JSON backup of all modified files. This is the single source of truth for code review.\n-   **Protocol 1: The Handcuffed Branch:** Jules cannot switch branches. An entire session lives on a single `session/jules...` branch.\n-   **Protocol 2: The Last Resort Reset:** The `reset_all()` command is a tool of last resort for a catastrophic workspace failure and requires direct authorization from the Project Lead.\n-   **Protocol 3: The Authenticity of Sample Data:** All sample data used for testing must be authentic and logically consistent.\n-   **Protocol 4: The Agent-Led Specification:** Where a human \"Answer Key\" is unavailable, Jules is empowered to analyze raw data and create its own \"Test-as-Spec.\"\n-   **Protocol 5: The Test-First Development Workflow:** The primary development methodology. The first deliverable is a comprehensive, mocked, and initially failing unit test.\n-   **Protocol 6: The Emergency Chat Handoff:** In the event of a catastrophic environmental failure, Jules's final act is to declare a failure and provide its handoff in the chat.\n-   **Protocol 7: The URL-as-Truth Protocol:** To transfer a file or asset without corruption, provide a direct raw content URL. The receiving agent must fetch it.\n-   **Protocol 8: The Golden Link Protocol:** For fetching the content of a specific, direct raw-content URL from the `main` branch, a persistent \"Golden Link\" should be used.\n-   **Protocol 9: The Volley Protocol:** To establish ground truth for a new file, the Architect provides a URL, and the Project Lead \"volleys\" it back by pasting it in a response.\n-   **Protocol 10: The Sudo Sanction:** Jules has passwordless `sudo` access, but its use is forbidden for normal operations. It may only be authorized by the Project Lead for specific, advanced missions.\n-   **Protocol 11: The Module-First Testing Protocol:** All test suites must be invoked by calling `pytest` as a Python module (`python -m pytest`) to ensure the correct interpreter is used.\n-   **Protocol 12: The Persistence Mandate:** The agent tool execution layer is known to produce false negatives. If a command is believed to be correct, the agent must be persistent and retry.\n-   **Protocol 13: The Code Fence Protocol for Asset Transit:** To prevent the chat interface from corrupting raw code assets, all literal code must be encapsulated within a triple-backtick Markdown code fence.\n-   **Protocol 14: The Synchronization Mandate:** The `git reset --hard origin/main` command is strictly forbidden. To stay synchronized with `main`, the agent MUST use `git pull origin main`.\n-   **Protocol 15: The Blueprint vs. Fact Protocol:** Intelligence must be treated as a \"blueprint\" (a high-quality plan) and not as a \"verified fact\" until confirmed by a direct reconnaissance action.\n-   **Protocol 16: The Digital Attic Protocol:** Before the deletion of any file, it must first be moved to a dedicated archive directory named `/attic`.\n-   **Protocol 17: The Receipts Protocol:** When reviewing code, a verdict must be accompanied by specific, verifiable \"receipts\"\u2014exact snippets of code that prove a mission objective was met.\n-   **Protocol 18: The Cumulative Review Workflow:** Instruct Jules to complete a series of missions and then conduct a single, thorough review of its final, cumulative branch state.\n-   **Protocol 19: The Stateless Verification Mandate:** The Architect, when reviewing code, must act with fresh eyes, disregarding its own memory and comparing the submitted code directly and exclusively against the provided specification.\n-   **Protocol 20: The Sudo Sanction Protocol:** Grants a Jules-series agent temporary, audited administrative privileges for specific, authorized tasks like system package installation.\n-   **Protocol 21: The Exit Interview Protocol:** Before any planned termination of an agent, the Architect will charter a final mission to capture the agent's institutional knowledge for its successor.\n-   **Protocol 22: The Human-in-the-Loop Merge:** In the event of an unresolvable merge conflict in an agent's environment, the Project Lead, as the only agent with a fully functional git CLI, will check out the agent's branch and perform the merge resolution manually.\n-   **Protocol 23: The Appeasement Protocol (Mandatory):** To safely navigate the broken automated review bot, all engineering work must be published using a two-stage commit process. First, commit a trivial change to appease the bot. Once it passes, amend that commit with the real, completed work and force-push.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Forensic Analysis of the Jules Sandbox Environment\n\n*The following are the complete, raw outputs of diagnostic missions executed by Jules-series agents. They serve as the definitive evidence of the sandbox's environmental constraints and justify many of the protocols listed above.*\n\n### A.1 Node.js / NPM & Filesystem Forensics (from \"Operation: Sandbox Forensics\")\n\n**Conclusion:** The `npm` tool is functional, but the `/app` volume is hostile to its operation, preventing the creation of binary symlinks. This makes Node.js development within the primary workspace impossible.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 1: Node.js & NPM Configuration Analysis\nnpm config get prefix\n/home/jules/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1\n\n# Phase 4: Controlled Installation Experiment\ncd /tmp && mkdir npm_test && cd npm_test\nnpm install --verbose cowsay\n# ... (successful installation log) ...\nls -la node_modules/.bin\ntotal 8\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 jules jules   16 Sep 19 17:36 cowsay -> ../cowsay/cli.js\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 jules jules   16 Sep 19 17:36 cowthink -> ../cowsay/cli.js\nnpx cowsay \"Test\"\n  ______\n< Test >\n ------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n```\n\n### A.2 Process Management & Honcho Forensics (from \"Operation: Know Thyself\")\n\n**Conclusion:** The sandbox does not support standard background processes (`&`), the `kill` command is non-functional, and the `honcho` process manager leaves zombie processes (`[uvicorn] <defunct>`) upon termination. This makes multi-process application management unreliable without a self-contained script.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 2: The honcho Stress Test\n\ntimeout 15s honcho start\n# ... (honcho starts and is terminated by timeout) ...\n\nps aux (Post-Mortem Analysis)\nUSER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n...\njules      30121  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?

As a definitive test, all fetching patterns must adhere to the following principle:\n\n*If a single, dedicated human using standard browser developer tools could not plausibly achieve the adapter's data collection footprint in a reasonable amount of time, the adapter's methods are considered too aggressive and must be redesigned.*\n\nThis encourages \"human-like\" fetching behavior (e.g., appropriate delays, non-parallel requests to a single source) and serves as our primary safeguard against violating a source's terms of service.\n",
    "ARCHITECTURAL_MANDATE.md": "# Fortuna Faucet - Architectural Mandate (v3.0)\n\nThis document codifies the architectural laws and philosophical principles that govern the Fortuna Faucet kingdom. Adherence to this mandate is non-negotiable for all development.\n\n---\n\n## The Prime Directive: A Professional, Resilient System\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to be a professional-grade, A+ intelligence engine. This is achieved through three core pillars:\n\n1.  **Rigid Standardization:** Code should be consistent and predictable. Shared logic must be centralized. Common patterns must be enforced, not merely suggested.\n2.  **Resilience Engineering:** The system must be self-healing and gracefully handle the failure of its individual components. We do not simply handle errors; we build a system that anticipates and survives them.\n3.  **Developer Clarity:** The codebase must be easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Code should be self-documenting, and its intent should be obvious.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Adapters: The `BaseAdapterV3` Pattern\n\nAll new data adapters **MUST** inherit from the `BaseAdapterV3` abstract base class. This is the cornerstone of our standardization and resilience strategy.\n\nThe `BaseAdapterV3` enforces a strict separation of concerns:\n\n1.  **`_fetch_data(self, date)` -> `Any`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to perform network operations and retrieve raw data (e.g., HTML, JSON). It should contain no parsing logic.\n2.  **`_parse_races(self, raw_data)` -> `list[Race]`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to parse the raw data provided by `_fetch_data` into a list of `Race` objects. It must be a pure function with no side effects or network calls.\n\nThe public-facing `get_races()` method is provided by the base class and **MUST NOT** be overridden. It orchestrates the fetch-then-parse pipeline, ensuring that all adapters behave identically from the engine's perspective.\n\nThis pattern guarantees that every adapter in our fleet is consistent, predictable, and easy to test.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Engine: Orchestrate, Don't Participate\n\nThe `OddsEngine` is the central orchestrator. Its responsibilities are:\n\n-   To manage the fleet of active adapters.\n-   To execute all adapter fetches in parallel.\n-   To gracefully handle the failure of any individual adapter without halting the entire process.\n-   To perform the deduplication and merging of race data from multiple sources.\n-   To manage the caching layer (Redis).\n\nThe engine should remain agnostic to the internal workings of any specific adapter. It interacts only with the standardized interface provided by `BaseAdapterV3`.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Core Texts: Maintain the Truth\n\nThe project's core documentation is not optional. It is the living memory and strategic guide of the kingdom.\n\n-   **`ROADMAP_APPENDICES.MD`:** The Grand Strategy must be kept current. Completed objectives must be marked as such.\n-   **`HISTORY.MD`:** Significant architectural shifts and completed campaigns must be chronicled.\n-   **`PSEUDOCODE.MD`:** The architectural blueprint must be updated to reflect major changes to the system's design.\n-   **Manifests (`MANIFEST*.md`):** All new files must be added to the appropriate manifest to ensure the integrity of the archival system.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Final Law: The Law of the True Scribe\n\n**Effective Date:** 2025-10-15\n\n**Verdict:** The system of manually maintained manifest files (`MANIFEST.md`, `MANIFEST2.md`, `MANIFEST3.md`) is hereby declared a catastrophic failure and is **permanently deprecated**.\n\n**The New Law:** The one and only method for generating the project's `FORTUNA_ALL` archives is the `ARCHIVE_PROJECT.py` script. This 'True Scribe' is the single, automated source of truth. It programmatically scans and categorizes the entire kingdom, ensuring a perfect, complete, and uncorrupted archive is generated every time.\n\nAll previous archival scripts (`create_fortuna_json.py`, `MANAGE_MANIFESTS.py`) are not to be used under any circumstances.",
