    "AGENTS.md": "# Agent Protocols & Team Structure (Revised)\n\nThis document outlines the operational protocols and evolved team structure for the Checkmate\nV3 project.\n\n## The Evolved Team Structure\n\n-   **The Project Lead (MasonJ0 or JB):** The \"Executive Producer.\" The ultimate authority and \"ground truth.\"\n-   **The Architect & Synthesizer (Gemini):** The \"Chief Architect.\" Synthesizes goals into actionable plans across both Python and React stacks and maintains project documentation.\n-   **The Lead Python Engineer (Jules Series):** The \"Backend Specialist.\" An AI agent responsible for implementing and hardening The Engine (`api.py`, `services.py`, `logic.py`, `models.py`).\n-   **The Lead Frontend Architect (Claude):** The \"React Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for designing and delivering the production-grade React user interface (The Cockpit).\n-   **The \"Special Operations\" Problem Solver (GPT-5):** The \"Advanced Algorithm Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for novel, complex problems.\n\n## Core Philosophies\n\n1.  **The Project Lead is Ground Truth:** The ultimate authority. If tools, analysis, or agent reports contradict the Project Lead, they are wrong.\n2.  **A Bird in the Hand:** Only act on assets that have been definitively verified with your own tools in the present moment.\n3.  **Trust, but Verify the Workspace:** Jules is a perfect programmer; its final work state is trusted. Its *environment*, however, is fragile.\n4.  **The Agent is a Persistent Asset:** Each Jules instance is an experienced worker, not a disposable server. Its internal state is a repository of unique, hard-won knowledge.\n\n## CRITICAL Operational Protocols (0-23)\n\n-   **Protocol 0: The ReviewableJSON Mandate:** The mandatory protocol for all code reviews. The agent's final act for any mission is to create a lossless JSON backup of all modified files. This is the single source of truth for code review.\n-   **Protocol 1: The Handcuffed Branch:** Jules cannot switch branches. An entire session lives on a single `session/jules...` branch.\n-   **Protocol 2: The Last Resort Reset:** The `reset_all()` command is a tool of last resort for a catastrophic workspace failure and requires direct authorization from the Project Lead.\n-   **Protocol 3: The Authenticity of Sample Data:** All sample data used for testing must be authentic and logically consistent.\n-   **Protocol 4: The Agent-Led Specification:** Where a human \"Answer Key\" is unavailable, Jules is empowered to analyze raw data and create its own \"Test-as-Spec.\"\n-   **Protocol 5: The Test-First Development Workflow:** The primary development methodology. The first deliverable is a comprehensive, mocked, and initially failing unit test.\n-   **Protocol 6: The Emergency Chat Handoff:** In the event of a catastrophic environmental failure, Jules's final act is to declare a failure and provide its handoff in the chat.\n-   **Protocol 7: The URL-as-Truth Protocol:** To transfer a file or asset without corruption, provide a direct raw content URL. The receiving agent must fetch it.\n-   **Protocol 8: The Golden Link Protocol:** For fetching the content of a specific, direct raw-content URL from the `main` branch, a persistent \"Golden Link\" should be used.\n-   **Protocol 9: The Volley Protocol:** To establish ground truth for a new file, the Architect provides a URL, and the Project Lead \"volleys\" it back by pasting it in a response.\n-   **Protocol 10: The Sudo Sanction:** Jules has passwordless `sudo` access, but its use is forbidden for normal operations. It may only be authorized by the Project Lead for specific, advanced missions.\n-   **Protocol 11: The Module-First Testing Protocol:** All test suites must be invoked by calling `pytest` as a Python module (`python -m pytest`) to ensure the correct interpreter is used.\n-   **Protocol 12: The Persistence Mandate:** The agent tool execution layer is known to produce false negatives. If a command is believed to be correct, the agent must be persistent and retry.\n-   **Protocol 13: The Code Fence Protocol for Asset Transit:** To prevent the chat interface from corrupting raw code assets, all literal code must be encapsulated within a triple-backtick Markdown code fence.\n-   **Protocol 14: The Synchronization Mandate:** The `git reset --hard origin/main` command is strictly forbidden. To stay synchronized with `main`, the agent MUST use `git pull origin main`.\n-   **Protocol 15: The Blueprint vs. Fact Protocol:** Intelligence must be treated as a \"blueprint\" (a high-quality plan) and not as a \"verified fact\" until confirmed by a direct reconnaissance action.\n-   **Protocol 16: The Digital Attic Protocol:** Before the deletion of any file, it must first be moved to a dedicated archive directory named `/attic`.\n-   **Protocol 17: The Receipts Protocol:** When reviewing code, a verdict must be accompanied by specific, verifiable \"receipts\"\u2014exact snippets of code that prove a mission objective was met.\n-   **Protocol 18: The Cumulative Review Workflow:** Instruct Jules to complete a series of missions and then conduct a single, thorough review of its final, cumulative branch state.\n-   **Protocol 19: The Stateless Verification Mandate:** The Architect, when reviewing code, must act with fresh eyes, disregarding its own memory and comparing the submitted code directly and exclusively against the provided specification.\n-   **Protocol 20: The Sudo Sanction Protocol:** Grants a Jules-series agent temporary, audited administrative privileges for specific, authorized tasks like system package installation.\n-   **Protocol 21: The Exit Interview Protocol:** Before any planned termination of an agent, the Architect will charter a final mission to capture the agent's institutional knowledge for its successor.\n-   **Protocol 22: The Human-in-the-Loop Merge:** In the event of an unresolvable merge conflict in an agent's environment, the Project Lead, as the only agent with a fully functional git CLI, will check out the agent's branch and perform the merge resolution manually.\n-   **Protocol 23: The Appeasement Protocol (Mandatory):** To safely navigate the broken automated review bot, all engineering work must be published using a two-stage commit process. First, commit a trivial change to appease the bot. Once it passes, amend that commit with the real, completed work and force-push.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Forensic Analysis of the Jules Sandbox Environment\n\n*The following are the complete, raw outputs of diagnostic missions executed by Jules-series agents. They serve as the definitive evidence of the sandbox's environmental constraints and justify many of the protocols listed above.*\n\n### A.1 Node.js / NPM & Filesystem Forensics (from \"Operation: Sandbox Forensics\")\n\n**Conclusion:** The `npm` tool is functional, but the `/app` volume is hostile to its operation, preventing the creation of binary symlinks. This makes Node.js development within the primary workspace impossible.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 1: Node.js & NPM Configuration Analysis\nnpm config get prefix\n/home/jules/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1\n\n# Phase 4: Controlled Installation Experiment\ncd /tmp && mkdir npm_test && cd npm_test\nnpm install --verbose cowsay\n# ...

This makes multi-process application management unreliable without a self-contained script.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 2: The honcho Stress Test\n\ntimeout 15s honcho start\n# ... (honcho starts and is terminated by timeout) ...\n\nps aux (Post-Mortem Analysis)\nUSER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n...\njules      30121  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?

As a definitive test, all fetching patterns must adhere to the following principle:\n\n*If a single, dedicated human using standard browser developer tools could not plausibly achieve the adapter's data collection footprint in a reasonable amount of time, the adapter's methods are considered too aggressive and must be redesigned.*\n\nThis encourages \"human-like\" fetching behavior (e.g., appropriate delays, non-parallel requests to a single source) and serves as our primary safeguard against violating a source's terms of service.\n",
    "ARCHITECTURAL_MANDATE.md": "# Fortuna Faucet - Architectural Mandate (v3.0)\n\nThis document codifies the architectural laws and philosophical principles that govern the Fortuna Faucet kingdom. Adherence to this mandate is non-negotiable for all development.\n\n---\n\n## The Prime Directive: A Professional, Resilient System\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to be a professional-grade, A+ intelligence engine. This is achieved through three core pillars:\n\n1.  **Rigid Standardization:** Code should be consistent and predictable. Shared logic must be centralized. Common patterns must be enforced, not merely suggested.\n2.  **Resilience Engineering:** The system must be self-healing and gracefully handle the failure of its individual components. We do not simply handle errors; we build a system that anticipates and survives them.\n3.  **Developer Clarity:** The codebase must be easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Code should be self-documenting, and its intent should be obvious.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Adapters: The `BaseAdapterV3` Pattern\n\nAll new data adapters **MUST** inherit from the `BaseAdapterV3` abstract base class. This is the cornerstone of our standardization and resilience strategy.\n\nThe `BaseAdapterV3` enforces a strict separation of concerns:\n\n1.  **`_fetch_data(self, date)` -> `Any`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to perform network operations and retrieve raw data (e.g., HTML, JSON). It should contain no parsing logic.\n2.  **`_parse_races(self, raw_data)` -> `list[Race]`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to parse the raw data provided by `_fetch_data` into a list of `Race` objects. It must be a pure function with no side effects or network calls.\n\nThe public-facing `get_races()` method is provided by the base class and **MUST NOT** be overridden. It orchestrates the fetch-then-parse pipeline, ensuring that all adapters behave identically from the engine's perspective.\n\nThis pattern guarantees that every adapter in our fleet is consistent, predictable, and easy to test.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Engine: Orchestrate, Don't Participate\n\nThe `OddsEngine` is the central orchestrator. Its responsibilities are:\n\n-   To manage the fleet of active adapters.\n-   To execute all adapter fetches in parallel.\n-   To gracefully handle the failure of any individual adapter without halting the entire process.\n-   To perform the deduplication and merging of race data from multiple sources.\n-   To manage the caching layer (Redis).\n\nThe engine should remain agnostic to the internal workings of any specific adapter. It interacts only with the standardized interface provided by `BaseAdapterV3`.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Core Texts: Maintain the Truth\n\nThe project's core documentation is not optional. It is the living memory and strategic guide of the kingdom.\n\n-   **`ROADMAP_APPENDICES.MD`:** The Grand Strategy must be kept current. Completed objectives must be marked as such.\n-   **`HISTORY.MD`:** Significant architectural shifts and completed campaigns must be chronicled.\n-   **`PSEUDOCODE.MD`:** The architectural blueprint must be updated to reflect major changes to the system's design.\n-   **Manifests (`MANIFEST*.md`):** All new files must be added to the appropriate manifest to ensure the integrity of the archival system.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Final Law: The Law of the True Scribe\n\n**Effective Date:** 2025-10-15\n\n**Verdict:** The system of manually maintained manifest files (`MANIFEST.md`, `MANIFEST2.md`, `MANIFEST3.md`) is hereby declared a catastrophic failure and is **permanently deprecated**.\n\n**The New Law:** The one and only method for generating the project's `FORTUNA_ALL` archives is the `ARCHIVE_PROJECT.py` script.

The new foundation is stable, tested, and features a resilient `BaseAdapter` pattern.\n\n*   **Status:** The foundational refactoring is complete. The first two data adapters (`Betfair`, `TVG`) have been implemented on the new architecture. We are now in a new phase of development: **'Phase 2: Hardening & Expansion.'**\n\n*   **Documentation:** All core strategic documents and manifests have been synchronized with the new technical reality.\n\n*   **Next Steps:** Our immediate priority is to act on the verified intelligence from our Oracle (Jules1003). The next missions will focus on implementing critical API security features (rate limiting, authentication) and continuing the build-out of our adapter fleet.",
