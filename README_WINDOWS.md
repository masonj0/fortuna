Welcome to Fortuna Faucet! This guide provides simple, step-by-step instructions to get you up and running.

## Installation

Installing the application is a straightforward process using our official installer.

1.  **Download the Installer:**
    *   Go to the [**Latest Release Page**](https://github.com/masonj0/fortuna/releases/latest) on GitHub.
    *   Download the file ending in `.msi` (e.g., `JBMason's 1st App-X.X.X.msi`).

2.  **Run the Installer:**
    *   Double-click the downloaded `.msi` file to launch the setup wizard.
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## What to Expect After Installation

Once the setup is complete, you will find a new folder in your Start Menu named **"JBMason's 1st App"**.

*   **Launching the App:** Inside this folder, click on the **"JBMason's 1st App"** shortcut to start the application.
*   **How it Works:** The shortcut launches the main application window (the dashboard). The backend data engine starts automatically in the background and will close when you exit the application.

That's it! All previous installation methods are now obsolete. Enjoy using the application!
