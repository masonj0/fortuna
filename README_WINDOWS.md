# üê¥ Fortuna Faucet - Windows Installation Guide (for End Users)

Welcome to Fortuna Faucet! Installing the application is now a simple, one-step process.

## The Official Installation Method

1.  **Go to the Latest Release Page:**
    *   Navigate to our official GitHub Releases page: [https://github.com/masonj0/fortuna/releases/latest](https://github.com/masonj0/fortuna/releases/latest)

2.  **Download the Installer:**
    *   Look for the file named `Fortuna-Faucet-Setup-vX.X.X.msi` (the version number will change).
    *   Download this file to your computer.

3.  **Run the Installer:**
    *   Double-click the downloaded `.msi` file.
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions in the setup wizard.

Once the installation is complete, you will find a "Fortuna Faucet" folder in your Start Menu. This folder contains a shortcut to launch the **Fortuna Faucet Dashboard**. The application's backend will run automatically as a background service whenever the application is open.

That's it! All previous methods involving Python scripts or batch files are now obsolete.
