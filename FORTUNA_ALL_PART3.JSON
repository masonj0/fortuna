    "ARCHITECTURAL_MANDATE.md": "# Fortuna Faucet - Architectural Mandate (v3.0)\n\nThis document codifies the architectural laws and philosophical principles that govern the Fortuna Faucet kingdom. Adherence to this mandate is non-negotiable for all development.\n\n---\n\n## The Prime Directive: A Professional, Resilient System\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to be a professional-grade, A+ intelligence engine. This is achieved through three core pillars:\n\n1.  **Rigid Standardization:** Code should be consistent and predictable. Shared logic must be centralized. Common patterns must be enforced, not merely suggested.\n2.  **Resilience Engineering:** The system must be self-healing and gracefully handle the failure of its individual components. We do not simply handle errors; we build a system that anticipates and survives them.\n3.  **Developer Clarity:** The codebase must be easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Code should be self-documenting, and its intent should be obvious.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Adapters: The `BaseAdapterV3` Pattern\n\nAll new data adapters **MUST** inherit from the `BaseAdapterV3` abstract base class. This is the cornerstone of our standardization and resilience strategy.\n\nThe `BaseAdapterV3` enforces a strict separation of concerns:\n\n1.  **`_fetch_data(self, date)` -> `Any`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to perform network operations and retrieve raw data (e.g., HTML, JSON). It should contain no parsing logic.\n2.  **`_parse_races(self, raw_data)` -> `list[Race]`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to parse the raw data provided by `_fetch_data` into a list of `Race` objects. It must be a pure function with no side effects or network calls.\n\nThe public-facing `get_races()` method is provided by the base class and **MUST NOT** be overridden. It orchestrates the fetch-then-parse pipeline, ensuring that all adapters behave identically from the engine's perspective.\n\nThis pattern guarantees that every adapter in our fleet is consistent, predictable, and easy to test.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Engine: Orchestrate, Don't Participate\n\nThe `OddsEngine` is the central orchestrator. Its responsibilities are:\n\n-   To manage the fleet of active adapters.\n-   To execute all adapter fetches in parallel.\n-   To gracefully handle the failure of any individual adapter without halting the entire process.\n-   To perform the deduplication and merging of race data from multiple sources.\n-   To manage the caching layer (Redis).\n\nThe engine should remain agnostic to the internal workings of any specific adapter. It interacts only with the standardized interface provided by `BaseAdapterV3`.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Core Texts: Maintain the Truth\n\nThe project's core documentation is not optional. It is the living memory and strategic guide of the kingdom.\n\n-   **`ROADMAP_APPENDICES.MD`:** The Grand Strategy must be kept current. Completed objectives must be marked as such.\n-   **`HISTORY.MD`:** Significant architectural shifts and completed campaigns must be chronicled.\n-   **`PSEUDOCODE.MD`:** The architectural blueprint must be updated to reflect major changes to the system's design.\n-   **Manifests (`MANIFEST*.md`):** All new files must be added to the appropriate manifest to ensure the integrity of the archival system.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Final Law: The Law of the True Scribe\n\n**Effective Date:** 2025-10-15\n\n**Verdict:** The system of manually maintained manifest files (`MANIFEST.md`, `MANIFEST2.md`, `MANIFEST3.md`) is hereby declared a catastrophic failure and is **permanently deprecated**.\n\n**The New Law:** The one and only method for generating the project's `FORTUNA_ALL` archives is the `ARCHIVE_PROJECT.py` script. This 'True Scribe' is the single, automated source of truth. It programmatically scans and categorizes the entire kingdom, ensuring a perfect, complete, and uncorrupted archive is generated every time.\n\nAll previous archival scripts (`create_fortuna_json.py`, `MANAGE_MANIFESTS.py`) are not to be used under any circumstances.",

    "README.md": "# \ud83d\udc34 Fortuna Faucet - Developer's Guide\n\nThis guide provides technical instructions for developers. **For end-user installation, please see the [User Guide (README_WINDOWS.md)](README_WINDOWS.md).**\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\nThe project has a distinct architecture for production and development environments. Understanding this separation is key to effective development.\n\n*   **Production Architecture (MSI Installer):**\n    *   **Standalone Backend:** The Python backend is compiled into a single, self-contained executable (`fortuna-api.exe`) using **PyInstaller**. This bundles the Python interpreter and all dependencies, requiring no Python installation on the user's machine.\n    *   **Static Frontend:** The Next.js frontend is exported as a set of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets.\n    *   **Electron Wrapper:** The Electron app acts as a lightweight shell, launching the backend executable as a background process and loading the static frontend directly from the filesystem.\n\n*   **Development Architecture:**\n    *   **Backend (`python_service/`):** An asynchronous FastAPI application run from a local Python virtual environment.\n    *   **Frontend (`web_platform/frontend/`):** A standard Next.js development server that enables hot-reloading for rapid UI development.\n\n## Development Environment\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\n*   Python 3.12+\n*   Node.js (LTS)\n*   Git\n\n### 2. Initial One-Time Setup\n\nFor your first time setting up the project, run the main setup script. This will create the Python virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/masonj0/fortuna.git\ncd fortuna\nrun_dev_environment.bat\n```\n\n### 3. Daily Execution (Backend)\n\nTo start the backend server, use the new official launcher script. This script ensures the server starts correctly and avoids common import errors.\n\n```bash\n# From the project root, with your virtual environment activated\npython run_backend.py\n```\n\nThis script will check for dependencies, ensure the environment is correct, and launch the Uvicorn server.\n\n**(Frontend)** To start the frontend server for UI development, run the following command in a separate terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev --prefix web_platform/frontend\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe backend server port can be configured using an environment variable.\n\n*   **`FORTUNA_PORT`**: Sets the port for the backend API service. Defaults to `8000` if not specified.\n\n**Example (PowerShell):**\n```powershell\n$env:FORTUNA_PORT=8088\npython run_backend.py\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Scripts & Tooling\n\n*   **`run_dev_environment.bat`**: The master script for the **initial one-time setup** of the development environment.\n*   **`scripts/fortuna-quick-start.ps1`**: The recommended script for **daily execution**, providing robust process management for both backend and frontend servers.\n*   **`scripts/build_msi.ps1`**: The local build orchestrator. This script runs the entire production build pipeline: it compiles the backend with PyInstaller, builds the static frontend, and packages everything into an MSI installer using the WiX Toolset.\n*   **`ARCHIVE_PROJECT.py`**: The \"True Scribe.\" This script programmatically scans the repository and generates the `FORTUNA_ALL_PART*.JSON` archive files, which are the authoritative source for project-wide code reviews.\n*   **`.github/workflows/build-msi.yml`**: The CI/CD pipeline definition for GitHub Actions, which automates the creation of the release MSI installer.\n",
    "STATUS.md": "# Project Status: Foundation Rebuilt, Hardening in Progress\n\n**Date:** 2025-10-03\n\n## Current State\n\n*   **Architecture:** The backend has been successfully rebuilt into a superior, asynchronous FastAPI application, as defined by 'Operation: Grand Synthesis'. The new foundation is stable, tested, and features a resilient `BaseAdapter` pattern.\n\n*   **Status:** The foundational refactoring is complete. The first two data adapters (`Betfair`, `TVG`) have been implemented on the new architecture. We are now in a new phase of development: **'Phase 2: Hardening & Expansion.'**\n\n*   **Documentation:** All core strategic documents and manifests have been synchronized with the new technical reality.\n\n*   **Next Steps:** Our immediate priority is to act on the verified intelligence from our Oracle (Jules1003). The next missions will focus on implementing critical API security features (rate limiting, authentication) and continuing the build-out of our adapter fleet.",
