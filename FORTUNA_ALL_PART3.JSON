    "ARCHITECTURAL_MANDATE.md": "# Fortuna Faucet - Architectural Mandate (v3.0)\n\nThis document codifies the architectural laws and philosophical principles that govern the Fortuna Faucet kingdom. Adherence to this mandate is non-negotiable for all development.\n\n---\n\n## The Prime Directive: A Professional, Resilient System\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to be a professional-grade, A+ intelligence engine. This is achieved through three core pillars:\n\n1.  **Rigid Standardization:** Code should be consistent and predictable. Shared logic must be centralized. Common patterns must be enforced, not merely suggested.\n2.  **Resilience Engineering:** The system must be self-healing and gracefully handle the failure of its individual components. We do not simply handle errors; we build a system that anticipates and survives them.\n3.  **Developer Clarity:** The codebase must be easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Code should be self-documenting, and its intent should be obvious.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Adapters: The `BaseAdapterV3` Pattern\n\nAll new data adapters **MUST** inherit from the `BaseAdapterV3` abstract base class. This is the cornerstone of our standardization and resilience strategy.\n\nThe `BaseAdapterV3` enforces a strict separation of concerns:\n\n1.  **`_fetch_data(self, date)` -> `Any`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to perform network operations and retrieve raw data (e.g., HTML, JSON). It should contain no parsing logic.\n2.  **`_parse_races(self, raw_data)` -> `list[Race]`:** This method's **only** responsibility is to parse the raw data provided by `_fetch_data` into a list of `Race` objects. It must be a pure function with no side effects or network calls.\n\nThe public-facing `get_races()` method is provided by the base class and **MUST NOT** be overridden. It orchestrates the fetch-then-parse pipeline, ensuring that all adapters behave identically from the engine's perspective.\n\nThis pattern guarantees that every adapter in our fleet is consistent, predictable, and easy to test.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Engine: Orchestrate, Don't Participate\n\nThe `OddsEngine` is the central orchestrator. Its responsibilities are:\n\n-   To manage the fleet of active adapters.\n-   To execute all adapter fetches in parallel.\n-   To gracefully handle the failure of any individual adapter without halting the entire process.\n-   To perform the deduplication and merging of race data from multiple sources.\n-   To manage the caching layer (Redis).\n\nThe engine should remain agnostic to the internal workings of any specific adapter. It interacts only with the standardized interface provided by `BaseAdapterV3`.\n\n---\n\n## The Law of the Core Texts: Maintain the Truth\n\nThe project's core documentation is not optional. It is the living memory and strategic guide of the kingdom.\n\n-   **`ROADMAP_APPENDICES.MD`:** The Grand Strategy must be kept current. Completed objectives must be marked as such.\n-   **`HISTORY.MD`:** Significant architectural shifts and completed campaigns must be chronicled.\n-   **`PSEUDOCODE.MD`:** The architectural blueprint must be updated to reflect major changes to the system's design.\n-   **Manifests (`MANIFEST*.md`):** All new files must be added to the appropriate manifest to ensure the integrity of the archival system.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Final Law: The Law of the True Scribe\n\n**Effective Date:** 2025-10-15\n\n**Verdict:** The system of manually maintained manifest files (`MANIFEST.md`, `MANIFEST2.md`, `MANIFEST3.md`) is hereby declared a catastrophic failure and is **permanently deprecated**.\n\n**The New Law:** The one and only method for generating the project's `FORTUNA_ALL` archives is the `ARCHIVE_PROJECT.py` script. This 'True Scribe' is the single, automated source of truth. It programmatically scans and categorizes the entire kingdom, ensuring a perfect, complete, and uncorrupted archive is generated every time.\n\nAll previous archival scripts (`create_fortuna_json.py`, `MANAGE_MANIFESTS.py`) are not to be used under any circumstances.",

    "PREV_ARCHITECTURAL_MANDATE_V8.1.md": "# ARCHITECTURAL MANDATE V8.1\nProject: Checkmate V7: The Ultimate Engine\nStatus: LOCKED & FINAL\nDate: 2025-09-26\n\n## 1.0 Abstract & Guiding Principles\n\nThis document is the final, locked architectural specification for the Checkmate V7 project. It reflects our strategic pivot to a CLI-first, two-stack system. It is required reading for all AI teammates and serves as the single source of truth for the system's design.\n\n### 1.1 The Two-Stack Architecture\n\nThe system is composed of two distinct, collaborating technology stacks:\n\n1.  **THE ENGINE (Python Backend):** A powerful, headless data processing and analysis application. Its sole purpose is to perform the heavy lifting and expose its capabilities via a JSON API.\n    *   `models.py` - THE BLUEPRINT (Data Structures & Contracts)\n    *   `logic.py` - THE BRAIN (Pure, Stateless Analysis)\n    *   `services.py` - THE GATEWAY (I/O & Orchestration)\n    *   `api.py` - THE CONDUCTOR (Stateless HTTP Interface)\n\n2.  **THE COCKPIT (User Interface):** The project's primary user interface. As of V8.1 and ROADMAP V5.0, this is implemented as a powerful, interactive Text User Interface (TUI) within the `run.py` script. It remains a pure client of The Engine.\n\n### 1.2 Guiding Policies\n\nAll implementation work must adhere to policies for Configuration via Environment, Comprehensive Structured Logging, and Graceful Error Handling.\n\n---\n\n## 2.0 Implementation Specification\n\n### 2.1 The Python Engine\n\nThe specifications for `models.py`, `logic.py`, `services.py`, and `api.py` remain the canonical blueprint for the Python backend. Their primary role is to serve the Cockpit.\n\n### 2.2 DEPRECATIONS\n\nThe primary user interface is now the \"Ultimate TUI\" defined in `ROADMAP V5.0`. The previously planned React application, along with the original Python-based `dashboard.py`, are now **DEPRECATED** and will be archived.\n\n### 2.3 The Headless Monitor\n\nThe `headless_monitor.py` remains a critical, first-class tool for developers and headless agents to monitor the status of The Engine's API. It is an essential part of the project's infrastructure and is not deprecated.",

It scores races on three factors:\n\n### Factor 1: Field Size (smaller is better)\n- **Why**: Fewer horses = easier to predict\n- **Default**: Maximum 10 runners\n\n### Factor 2: Favorite's Odds (higher is better)\n- **Why**: If the favorite is 2.5+, the race is wide open\n- **Default**: Minimum 2.5\n\n### Factor 3: Second Favorite's Odds (higher is better)\n- **Why**: Confirms multiple horses are competitive\n- **Default**: Minimum 4.0\n\n**The Score**: Combines all three into a 0-100% match rating!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda System Architecture (Simplified)\n\n```\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502     \ud83c\udf10 Next.js Dashboard (Port 3000)    \u2502\n\u2502     Your beautiful web interface        \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                   \u2502 API Calls\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502   \ud83d\udc0d Python FastAPI Backend (Port 8000) \u2502\n\u2502   - OddsEngine: Fetches from 20+ sources\u2502\n\u2502   - TrifectaAnalyzer: Scores races      \u2502\n\u2502   - LiveOddsMonitor: Betfair tracking   \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                   \u2502 Async Requests\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502     \ud83d\udd0c Adapter Fleet (20+ sources)      \u2502\n\u2502  TVG \u2022 Betfair \u2022 TimeForm \u2022 GBGB       \u2502\n\u2502  RacingAndSports \u2022 USTA \u2022 And more!     \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd10 Security Notes\n\n### API Keys\n- **Your local API_KEY**: Only for communication between YOUR backend and frontend\n- Never shared online, never exposed\n- Auto-generated during setup\n\n### External API Keys (Optional)\nAdd these to `.env` for more data sources:\n```\nTVG_API_KEY=\"your_tvg_key\"\nRACING_AND_SPORTS_TOKEN=\"your_ras_token\"\nTHE_RACING_API_KEY=\"your_theracingapi_key\"\n```\n\nGet keys from:\n- TVG: https://www.tvg.com/promos/developer-api\n- Racing and Sports: https://www.racingandsports.com/data-api/\n- The Racing API: https://www.theracingapi.com/\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Backend Offline\" Error\n```batch\n# Stop everything cleanly\nSTOP_FORTUNA.bat\n\n# Wait 10 seconds, then restart\nLAUNCH_FORTUNA.bat\n```\n\n### Dashboard Loads But No Data\n1. Open `http://localhost:8000/health` in browser\n2. Should show: `{\"status\": \"OK\"}`\n3. If not, check Python backend window for errors\n\n### \"Port Already In Use\" Error\nSomeone else is using port 8000 or 3000:\n```batch\n# Windows: Kill processes on those ports\nnetstat -ano | findstr :8000\ntaskkill /PID [number] /F\n\nnetstat -ano | findstr :3000\ntaskkill /PID [number] /F\n```\n\n### Reset Everything\n```batch\n# Nuclear option: Clean slate\nSTOP_FORTUNA.bat\ndel .env\nsetup_wizard.py\nINSTALL_FORTUNA.bat\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 File Structure Explained\n\n### Critical Files (Don't Delete!)\n- `.env` - Your configuration (API keys, settings)\n- `requirements.txt` - Python packages list\n- `package.json` - Node.js packages list\n\n### Convenience Scripts\n- `LAUNCH_FORTUNA.bat` - Start everything\n- `STOP_FORTUNA.bat` - Stop everything\n- `RESTART_FORTUNA.bat` - Clean restart\n- `setup_wizard.py` - Interactive config tool\n\n### Python Backend (`python_service/`)\n- `api.py` - Web server (FastAPI)\n- `engine.py` - Master data orchestrator\n- `analyzer.py` - Race scoring logic\n- `models.py` - Data structure definitions\n- `adapters/` - Individual data source plugins\n\n### Frontend (`web_platform/frontend/`)\n- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main dashboard\n- `src/components/RaceCard.tsx` - Individual race display\n- `.env.local` - Frontend API key\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf93 Customization Ideas\n\n### Change Analyzer Thresholds\nEdit `python_service/analyzer.py`:\n```python\nclass TrifectaAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):\n    def __init__(self,\n                 max_field_size: int = 8,      # \u2190 Change this\n                 min_favorite_odds: float = 3.0, # \u2190 Or this\n                 min_second_favorite_odds: float = 5.0): # \u2190 Or this\n```\n\n### Add New Data Sources\n1. Copy `python_service/adapters/template_adapter.py`\n2. Rename and implement the `fetch_races()` method\n3. Register in `python_service/adapters/__init__.py`\n4. Add to `python_service/engine.py` adapter list\n\n### Customize Dashboard Colors\nEdit `web_platform/frontend/tailwind.config.ts`:\n```typescript\ntheme: {\n  extend: {\n    colors: {\n      'fortuna-primary': '#your-hex-color',\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Pro Tips\n\n### Tip 1: Use Windows Task Scheduler\nRun `SCHEDULE_FORTUNA.bat` for:\n- Auto-start on login\n- Daily 3 AM maintenance restart\n\n### Tip 2: Monitor Multiple Days\nThe analyzer works for \"today\" by default, but you can query any date:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8000/api/races/qualified/trifecta?race_date=2025-10-25\n```\n\n### Tip 3: Export Data\nThe API returns pure JSON. Use tools like:\n- **Postman** for testing\n- **PowerShell** for scripting:\n```powershell\nInvoke-RestMethod -Uri \"http://localhost:8000/api/races/qualified/trifecta\" `\n  -Headers @{\"X-API-Key\"=\"your_key\"} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10\n```\n\n### Tip 4: Mobile Access\nIf you want to check from your phone on the same WiFi:\n1. Find your PC's IP: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt\n2. Open firewall port 3000\n3. Access from phone: `http://192.168.1.X:3000`\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf89 You're Ready!\n\nThis is a **professional-grade** system that you now control.
