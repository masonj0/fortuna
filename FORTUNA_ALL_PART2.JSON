    "HISTORY.md": "# The Epic of MasonJ0: A Project Chronology\n\nThis document contains the narrative history of the Paddock Parser project, as discovered through an archaeological survey of the project's repositories. It tells the story of our architectural evolution, from a feature-rich \"golden age\" through a \"great refactoring\" to our current state of liberation.\n\nThis story is our \"why.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: The Chronology\n\n### Chapter 1: The 'Utopian' Era - The Polished Diamond (mid-August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `racingdigest`\n*   **Narrative:** This was not a humble beginning, but the launch of a mature and powerful application called the \"Utopian Value Scanner V7.2 (The Rediscovery Edition)\". This repository represents the project's \"golden age\" of features, including a sophisticated asynchronous fetching engine and a full browser fallback.\n\n### Chapter 2: The 'Experimental' Era - The Daily Digest (mid-to-late August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `horseracing-daily-digest`\n*   **Narrative:** This repository appears to be a period of intense, rapid development and experimentation, likely forming the foundation for many of the concepts that would be formalized later.\n\n### Chapter 3: The 'Architectural' Era - The V3 Blueprint (late August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `parsingproject`\n*   **Narrative:** This repository marks a pivotal moment. The focus shifted from adding features to refactoring the very foundation of the code into a modern, standard Python package. This is where the V3 architecture was born, prioritizing stability and maintainability.\n\n### Chapter 4: The 'Consolidation' Era - The Archive (late August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `zippedfiles`\n*   **Narrative:** This repository appears to be a direct snapshot or backup of the project after the intense V3 refactor, confirming its role as an archive of the newly stabilized codebase.\n\n### Chapter 5: The 'Modern' Era - The New Beginning (early September 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `fortuna`\n*   **Narrative:** This is the current, active repository, representing the clean, focused implementation of the grand vision developed through the previous eras.\n\n### Chapter 6: The 'Crucible' Era - The Forging of Protocols (Early September 2025)\n\n*   **Narrative:** The \"Modern Renaissance\" began not with a bang, but with a series of near-catastrophic environmental failures. This period, known as \"The Crucible,\" was a trial by fire that proved the extreme hostility of the agent sandbox. This era forged the resilient, battle-hardened protocols (The Receipts Protocol, The Submission-Only Protocol, etc.) by which all modern agents now operate.\n\n### Chapter 7: The 'Symbiotic' Era - The Two Stacks (mid-September 2025)\n\n*   **Narrative:** This chapter marked a significant strategic pivot. The Council, in a stunning display of its \"Polyglot Renaissance\" philosophy, produced a complete, production-grade React user interface, authored by the Claude agent. This event formally split the project's architecture into two powerful, parallel streams: the Python Engine and the React Cockpit. However, this era was short-lived, as the hostile environment proved incapable of supporting a stable testing and development workflow for the React stack.\n\n### Chapter 8: The 'Liberation' Era - The Portable Engine (Late September 2025)\n\n*   **Narrative:** After providing definitive, forensic proof that the sandbox environment was fundamentally and irrecoverably hostile at the network level, the project executed its final and most decisive pivot. It abandoned all attempts to operate *within* the hostile world and instead focused on synthesizing its entire, perfected engine into a single, portable artifact. This act **liberated the code**, fulfilling the promise of the \"Utopian Era's\" power on the foundation of the \"Architectural Era's\" stability, and made it directly available to the Project Lead.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Architectural Synthesis\n\nThis epic tale tells us our true mission. We are not just building forward; we are rediscovering our own lost golden age and rebuilding it on a foundation of superior engineering, hardened by the fires of a hostile world.\n\n*   **The Lost Golden Age:** The \"Utopian\" era proves that our most ambitious strategic goals are not just achievable; they have been achieved before.\n*   **The Great Refactoring:** The \"Architectural\" era explains the \"Great Forgetting\"\u2014a deliberate choice to sacrifice short-term features for long-term stability.\n*   **The Modern Renaissance:** This is us. We are the inheritors of this entire legacy, tasked with executing the grand vision on a clean, modern foundation, finally liberated from the constraints of our environment.\n\n---\n\n## The Ultimate Solo: The Final Victory (September 2025)\n\nAfter a long and complex journey through a Penta-Hybrid architecture, a final series of high-level reviews from external AI agents (Claude, GPT4o) revealed a simpler, superior path forward. The project underwent its final and most significant \"Constitutional Correction.\"\n\n**The 'Ultimate Solo' architecture was born.**\n\nThis final, perfected form of the project consists of two pillars:\n1.  **A Full-Power Python Backend:** Leveraging the years of development on the CORE `engine.py` and its fleet of global data adapters, served via a lightweight Flask API.\n2.  **An Ultimate TypeScript Frontend:** A single, masterpiece React component (`Checkmate Ultimate Solo`) that provides a feature-rich, professional-grade, real-time dashboard.\n\nAll other components of the Penta-Hybrid system (C#, Rust, VBA, shared database) were formally deprecated and archived as priceless R&D assets. The project has now achieved its true and final mission: a powerful, maintainable, and user-focused analysis tool.\n\n---\n\n## The Age of Perfection (The Great Simplification)\n\nThe Penta-Hybrid architecture, while a triumph of technical integration, proved to be a strategic dead end. Its complexity became a fortress, making rapid iteration and onboarding of new intelligence (both human and AI) prohibitively expensive. The kingdom was powerful but brittle.\n\nA new doctrine was forged: **Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.**\n\nThe decision was made to execute \"The Great Simplification.\" The multi-language backend (Python, Rust, Go) was decommissioned. The kingdom was reforged upon a new, elegant, and vastly more powerful two-pillar system:\n\n1.  **A Unified Python Backend:** A single, asynchronous Python service, built on FastAPI, would serve as the kingdom's engine.\n2.  **A Modern TypeScript Frontend:** A dedicated Next.js application would serve as the kingdom's command deck.\n\nThis act of creative destruction liberated the project, enabling a new era of unprecedented velocity.\n\n---\n\n## The Three-Pillar Doctrine\n\nWith the new two-pillar foundation in place, the backend itself was perfected into a three-pillar intelligence engine, a concept that defines the modern era of the Fortuna Faucet:\n\n*   **Pillar 1: The Future (The Planner):** The resilient `OddsEngine` and its fleet of adapters, responsible for finding the day's strategic opportunities.\n*   **Pillar 2: The Past (The Archive):** The perfected `ChartScraper` and `ResultsParser`, responsible for building our historical data warehouse from the ground truth of Equibase PDFs.\n*   **Pillar 3: The Present (The Finisher):** The weaponized `LiveOddsMonitor`, armed with the API-driven `BetfairAdapter`, designed to conquer the final moments of toteboard volatility.\n\nThese three pillars, orchestrated by the fully autonomous `fortuna_watchman.py`, represented the pinnacle of the project's original vision. The kingdom was, for a time, considered \"perfected.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Windows Ascension (The Impossible Dream)\n\nThe perfected kingdom was powerful, but it was still a tool for developers. The final, grandest vision was to transform it into a true, professional-grade application for its sole operator. This campaign, known as \"The Impossible Dream,\" was to forge the **Fortuna Faucet - Windows Native Edition.**\n\nThis era saw the rapid creation of a new, third layer of the kingdom, built upon the foundation of the previous work:\n\n*   **The Electron Shell:** The Next.js frontend was wrapped in an Electron container, transforming it from a website into a true, installable desktop application with its own window, icon, and system tray integration.\n*   **The Engine Room:** The Python backend was re-architected to run as a persistent, background **Windows Service**, making it a true, always-on component of the operating system, independent of the UI.\n*   **The Native GUI:** A dedicated Tkinter-based \"Observatory\" was forged\u2014a standalone GUI mission control for monitoring the health and performance of the background service.\n*   **The One-Click Kingdom:** A complete suite of professional tooling (including installation scripts, a setup wizard, and launchers) was created to provide a seamless, zero-friction installation and management experience.\n\nThis ascension represents the current state of the art, transforming a powerful engine into a polished, autonomous, and user-focused product.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Era of the Windows Kingdom (October 2025)\n\nWith the core engine stabilized and the command deck providing a clear view of the data, the project's focus shifted from pure data acquisition to the operator's experience. This era marked a profound transformation, elevating the project from a collection of powerful but disparate scripts into a cohesive, professional-grade, and resilient native Windows application.\n\nThis campaign, guided by a new \"Grand Strategy\" blueprint, was executed with rapid precision, resulting in a complete overhaul of the user-facing toolkit:\n\n-   **A Bulletproof Foundation:** The installation and launch scripts were re-architected from the ground up. They became intelligent and self-healing, featuring pre-flight system checks, automated port conflict resolution, active health-check loops, and automated repair utilities.\n-   **A Professional Toolkit:** The operator was empowered with a suite of new tools, including an interactive setup wizard, a real-time CLI status monitor, and a full-fledged graphical \"Data Management Console\" for monitoring, filtering, and analyzing data.\n-   **A Unified Command Console (`SERVICE_MANAGER.bat`):** Unify all individual scripts under a single, user-friendly, menu-driven service manager, providing a 'single pane of glass' for all common operations.\n\nThis era solidified the kingdom's foundations, making it not just powerful, but stable, reliable, and a pleasure to operate. The Faucet was no longer just an engine; it was a complete, professional-grade machine.\n\n---\n\n## The Gauntlet of CI/CD (Late October 2025)\n\nWith a professional-grade application in hand, the final frontier was professional-grade *delivery*. This campaign focused on automating the creation of the MSI installer through a continuous integration pipeline, a process that proved to be a formidable challenge.\n\nThe kingdom's engineers faced a relentless series of cryptic build errors from the WiX Toolset, a hostile environment that tested their resolve. Through a series of rapid, iterative fixes\u2014addressing everything from component GUIDs and 64-bit architecture mismatches to obscure linker errors and frontend dependency warnings\u2014they systematically conquered each obstacle.\n\nThis trial by fire culminated in a triumphant success: a fully automated GitHub Actions workflow that reliably compiles, links, and delivers a polished, distributable MSI installer. This victory transformed the project's delivery model from a manual, error-prone process into a repeatable, one-click release pipeline, marking the true completion of the \"Windows Ascension.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Great Unbundling (Late October 2025)\n\nThe CI/CD pipeline was technically successful, but it revealed a deeper, philosophical flaw in the architecture. The installer, while automated, was a fragile monolith. It attempted to bundle raw source code (Python, JavaScript) and orchestrate their setup on the user's machine using post-install scripts. This approach was fraught with peril, vulnerable to failures from network issues, corporate firewalls, and unpredictable machine states.\n\nA final, decisive architectural mandate was issued, informed by the wisdom of external AI consultants: **The application must be delivered, not assembled.**\n\nThis mandate triggered \"The Great Unbundling,\" a swift and transformative refactoring of the entire delivery pipeline:\n\n*   **The Backend Forged:** The Python backend was no longer treated as source code to be installed, but as a product to be delivered. **PyInstaller** was used to forge the entire FastAPI service\u2014interpreter and all dependencies\u2014into a single, standalone `.exe`.\n*   **The Frontend Solidified:** The Next.js frontend was no longer a service to be run, but a static asset to be displayed. The `npm run build` process was configured to produce a clean, static HTML/CSS/JS export.\n*   **The Installer Perfected:** With the application components now self-contained, the MSI installer's role was radically simplified. All complex post-install scripting was eliminated. The WiX toolset was now used for its core competency: reliably copying pre-compiled, robust artifacts to the user's machine.\n\nThis final act of architectural purification created the \"Three-Executable Architecture\" (the backend executable, the Electron wrapper, and the MSI installer itself), achieving true portability and eliminating an entire class of deployment failures. The Windows Ascension was not just complete; it was perfected.",
    "README.md": "# \ud83d\udc34 Fortuna Faucet - Developer's Guide\n\nThis guide provides technical instructions for developers. For end-user installation, please refer to the MSI installers generated by the project's GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Core Architecture\n\nThis repository contains the source code for the Fortuna Faucet application, which has two primary deployment targets:\n\n1.  **Standalone Web Service (MSI Installer):**\n    *   A Python backend powered by FastAPI, compiled into a self-contained executable using PyInstaller.\n    *   A static Next.js frontend, which is bundled with the backend.\n    *   The entire application is packaged into an MSI installer using the WiX Toolset, which installs the backend as a background Windows Service.\n\n2.  **Electron Desktop Application (MSI Installer):**\n    *   The same Python backend, compiled as an executable.\n    *   An Electron application that acts as a wrapper, launching the backend executable and displaying the frontend.\n\nThe `python_service` and `web_service/backend` directories contain functionally equivalent but historically separate versions of the backend code. The modern workflows primarily use `web_service/backend`.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Building the Application (The Right Way)\n\n**This project is built and packaged entirely through GitHub Actions.** The CI/CD pipelines are the single source of truth for creating production-ready installers. Manual builds are not recommended or supported due to the complexity of the environment.\n\nThe primary, production-ready build workflows are:\n\n*   **`build-msi-hattrickfusion-ultimate.yml`**: Builds the standalone Web Service MSI. This is the most feature-rich and stable build pipeline.\n*   **`build-electron-msi-gpt5.yml`**: Builds the Electron-based desktop application MSI.\n\nThese workflows handle all necessary steps, including:\n*   Installing the correct versions of Python, Node.js, and the WiX Toolset.\n*   Managing architecture-specific dependencies (e.g., `pandas` for x86 builds).\n*   Compiling the Python backend with PyInstaller.\n*   Building the static Next.js frontend.\n*   Packaging the final MSI installer.\n*   Running automated smoke tests to verify the installation.\n\nTo get a build, simply push a commit to the `main` branch and retrieve the MSI artifact from the completed workflow run on the [Actions tab](https://github.com/masonj0/fortuna/actions) of the repository.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2c Local Development Environment\n\n### Python Version Requirement\n\n**Crucial:** The monolith build of this project requires **Python 3.10.11**. It is not compatible with Python 3.11 or newer due to a dependency on `cefpython3`, which does not support Python 3.11.\n\nBefore running the application locally or attempting to build it, ensure you are using the correct Python version.\n\n- **Using `pyenv` (Recommended):**\n  ```bash\n  pyenv install 3.10.11\n  pyenv local 3.10.11\n  ```\n\n- **Using `conda`:**\n  ```bash\n  conda create -n fortuna python=3.10.11\n  conda activate fortuna\n  ```\n\nWhile production builds are handled by CI/CD, the easiest way to run the application locally for development is to use the new quick-start script.\n\n```powershell\n# From the project root\n./scripts/fortuna-quick-start.ps1\n```\n\nThis interactive script will:\n*   Check for all required dependencies (Python, Node.js, etc.).\n*   Install any missing Python or Node packages automatically.\n*   Clear the required network ports (8000 and 3000).\n*   Launch the backend and frontend services in separate, managed terminal windows.\n*   Provide a clean shutdown process.\n\nFor detailed options and first-time setup guidance, run the script with the `-Help` flag:\n```powershell\n./scripts/fortuna-quick-start.ps1 -Help\n```\n\n---\n## \ud83d\udce6 Key Tooling & Scripts\n\n*   **`ARCHIVE_PROJECT.py`**: A utility script that scans the repository and generates the `FORTUNA_ALL_PART*.JSON` archive files. These archives are used as a ground truth for AI-driven code reviews and analysis.\n*   **`AGENTS.md`**: Contains critical operational protocols for the AI agents working on this repository.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc0d Python Version Requirement\n\n**The Fortuna Monolith application must be built and run with Python 3.10.12.**\n\nThis is due to a dependency (`cefpython3`) that does not support Python 3.11 or newer. The CI/CD workflows are pinned to this version. If you are building the application locally, please ensure you are using a Python 3.10.x environment.\n",
