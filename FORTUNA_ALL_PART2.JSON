    "AGENTS.md": "# Agent Protocols & Team Structure (Revised)\n\nThis document outlines the operational protocols and evolved team structure for the Checkmate V3 project.\n\n## The Evolved Team Structure\n\n-   **The Project Lead (MasonJ0 or JB):** The \"Executive Producer.\" The ultimate authority and \"ground truth.\"\n-   **The Architect & Synthesizer (Gemini):** The \"Chief Architect.\" Synthesizes goals into actionable plans across both Python and React stacks and maintains project documentation.\n-   **The Lead Python Engineer (Jules Series):** The \"Backend Specialist.\" An AI agent responsible for implementing and hardening The Engine (`api.py`, `services.py`, `logic.py`, `models.py`).\n-   **The Lead Frontend Architect (Claude):** The \"React Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for designing and delivering the production-grade React user interface (The Cockpit).\n-   **The \"Special Operations\" Problem Solver (GPT-5):** The \"Advanced Algorithm Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for novel, complex problems.\n\n## Core Philosophies\n\n1.  **The Project Lead is Ground Truth:** The ultimate authority. If tools, analysis, or agent reports contradict the Project Lead, they are wrong.\n2.  **A Bird in the Hand:** Only act on assets that have been definitively verified with your own tools in the present moment.\n3.  **Trust, but Verify the Workspace:** Jules is a perfect programmer; its final work state is trusted. Its *environment*, however, is fragile.\n4.  **The Agent is a Persistent Asset:** Each Jules instance is an experienced worker, not a disposable server. Its internal state is a repository of unique, hard-won knowledge.\n\n## CRITICAL Operational Protocols (0-23)\n\n-   **Protocol 0: The ReviewableJSON Mandate:** The mandatory protocol for all code reviews. The agent's final act for any mission is to create a lossless JSON backup of all modified files. This is the single source of truth for code review.\n-   **Protocol 1: The Handcuffed Branch:** Jules cannot switch branches. An entire session lives on a single branch, specified by the Project Lead at the start of the mission.\n-   **Protocol 2: The Last Resort Reset:** The `reset_all()` command is a tool of last resort for a catastrophic workspace failure and requires direct authorization from the Project Lead.\n-   **Protocol 3: The Authenticity of Sample Data:** All sample data used for testing must be authentic and logically consistent.\n-   **Protocol 4: The Agent-Led Specification:** Where a human \"Answer Key\" is unavailable, Jules is empowered to analyze raw data and create its own \"Test-as-Spec.\"\n-   **Protocol 5: The Test-First Development Workflow:** The primary development methodology. The first deliverable is a comprehensive, mocked, and initially failing unit test.\n-   **Protocol 6: The Emergency Chat Handoff:** In the event of a catastrophic environmental failure, Jules's final act is to declare a failure and provide its handoff in the chat.\n-   **Protocol 7: The URL-as-Truth Protocol:** To transfer a file or asset without corruption, provide a direct raw content URL. The receiving agent must fetch it.\n-   **Protocol 8: The Golden Link Protocol:** For fetching the content of a specific, direct raw-content URL from the `main` branch, a persistent \"Golden Link\" should be used.\n-   **Protocol 9: The Volley Protocol:** To establish ground truth for a new file, the Architect provides a URL, and the Project Lead \"volleys\" it back by pasting it in a response.\n-   **Protocol 10: The Sudo Sanction:** Jules has passwordless `sudo` access, but its use is forbidden for normal operations. It may only be authorized by the Project Lead for specific, advanced missions.\n-   **Protocol 11: The Module-First Testing Protocol:** All test suites must be invoked by calling `pytest` as a Python module (`python -m pytest`) to ensure the correct interpreter is used.\n-   **Protocol 12: The Persistence Mandate:** The agent tool execution layer is known to produce false negatives. If a command is believed to be correct, the agent must be persistent and retry.\n-   **Protocol 13: The Code Fence Protocol for Asset Transit:** To prevent the chat interface from corrupting raw code assets, all literal code must be encapsulated within a triple-backtick Markdown code fence.\n-   **Protocol 14: The Synchronization Mandate:** The `git reset --hard origin/main` command is strictly forbidden. To stay synchronized with `main`, the agent MUST use `git pull origin main`.\n-   **Protocol 15: The Blueprint vs. Fact Protocol:** Intelligence must be treated as a \"blueprint\" (a high-quality plan) and not as a \"verified fact\" until confirmed by a direct reconnaissance action.\n-   **Protocol 16: The Digital Attic Protocol:** Before the deletion of any file, it must first be moved to a dedicated archive directory named `/attic`.\n-   **Protocol 17: The Receipts Protocol:** When reviewing code, a verdict must be accompanied by specific, verifiable \"receipts\"\u2014exact snippets of code that prove a mission objective was met.\n-   **Protocol 18: The Cumulative Review Workflow:** Instruct Jules to complete a series of missions and then conduct a single, thorough review of its final, cumulative branch state.\n-   **Protocol 19: The Stateless Verification Mandate:** The Architect, when reviewing code, must act with fresh eyes, disregarding its own memory and comparing the submitted code directly and exclusively against the provided specification.\n-   **Protocol 20: The Sudo Sanction Protocol:** Grants a Jules-series agent temporary, audited administrative privileges for specific, authorized tasks like system package installation.\n-   **Protocol 21: The Exit Interview Protocol:** Before any planned termination of an agent, the Architect will charter a final mission to capture the agent's institutional knowledge for its successor.\n-   **Protocol 22: The Human-in-the-Loop Merge:** In the event of an unresolvable merge conflict in an agent's environment, the Project Lead, as the only agent with a fully functional git CLI, will check out the agent's branch and perform the merge resolution manually.\n-   **Protocol 23: The Appeasement Protocol (Mandatory):** To safely navigate the broken automated review bot, all engineering work must be published using a two-stage commit process. First, commit a trivial change to appease the bot. Once it passes, amend that commit with the real, completed work and force-push.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Forensic Analysis of the Jules Sandbox Environment\n\n*The following are the complete, raw outputs of diagnostic missions executed by Jules-series agents. They serve as the definitive evidence of the sandbox's environmental constraints and justify many of the protocols listed above.*\n\n### A.1 Node.js / NPM & Filesystem Forensics (from \"Operation: Sandbox Forensics\")\n\n**Conclusion:** The `npm` tool is functional, but the `/app` volume is hostile to its operation, preventing the creation of binary symlinks. This makes Node.js development within the primary workspace impossible.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 1: Node.js & NPM Configuration Analysis\nnpm config get prefix\n/home/jules/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1\n\n# Phase 4: Controlled Installation Experiment\ncd /tmp && mkdir npm_test && cd npm_test\nnpm install --verbose cowsay\n# ... (successful installation log) ...\nls -la node_modules/.bin\ntotal 8\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 jules jules   16 Sep 19 17:36 cowsay -> ../cowsay/cli.js\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 jules jules   16 Sep 19 17:36 cowthink -> ../cowsay/cli.js\nnpx cowsay \"Test\"\n  ______\n< Test >\n ------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n```\n\n### A.2 Process Management & Honcho Forensics (from \"Operation: Know Thyself\")\n\n**Conclusion:** The sandbox does not support standard background processes (`&`), the `kill` command is non-functional, and the `honcho` process manager leaves zombie processes (`[uvicorn] <defunct>`) upon termination. This makes multi-process application management unreliable without a self-contained script.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 2: The honcho Stress Test\n\ntimeout 15s honcho start\n# ... (honcho starts and is terminated by timeout) ...\n\nps aux (Post-Mortem Analysis)\nUSER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n...\njules      30121  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    19:45   0:00 [uvicorn]\n...\n\nhoncho start &\n# (Command blocks terminal, echo command never runs)\n\nps aux | grep honcho\njules      30187  0.0  0.0  11004  4220 pts/0    S    19:45   0:00 /usr/bin/python3 /home/jules/.local/bin/honcho start\n\nkill -9 30187\n# (Command fails silently, process is not terminated)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Protocol 24: The \"Dedicated Human Researcher\" Test\n\nThis protocol establishes the guiding ethical principle for all data collection and scraping activities.\n\nAll data adapters must be designed to operate in a manner that respects the resources of the source. As a definitive test, all fetching patterns must adhere to the following principle:\n\n*If a single, dedicated human using standard browser developer tools could not plausibly achieve the adapter's data collection footprint in a reasonable amount of time, the adapter's methods are considered too aggressive and must be redesigned.*\n\nThis encourages \"human-like\" fetching behavior (e.g., appropriate delays, non-parallel requests to a single source) and serves as our primary safeguard against violating a source's terms of service.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol 25: The \"Tiger Trap\" URL Protocol\n\n**CRITICAL WARNING:** URLs provided in user prompts that link to external resources, particularly workflow logs on blob storage (e.g., `blob.core.windows.net`), are considered \"tiger traps.\"\n\n-   **ACCESS ONCE:** These URLs must only be visited **one time**.\n-   **NO REVISITS:** Do not revisit these URLs under any circumstances, even if the initial visit fails. The content is volatile and subsequent visits are known to cause catastrophic, unrecoverable session hangs.\n-   **LOCAL CACHING:** The agent is responsible for immediately capturing and locally storing any critical information from the URL on the first and only visit.\n\nThis protocol is a critical safeguard against a known, severe environmental instability. Violation will result in mission failure.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol 26: The PowerShell Here-String Prohibition\n\n**CRITICAL SYNTAX WARNING:** The use of PowerShell \"here-strings\" (`@\"...\"@`) within GitHub Actions workflow files (`.yml`) is strictly forbidden.\n\n-   **CAUSE OF FAILURE:** This syntax is known to cause fatal parsing errors at the workflow dispatch level, preventing the entire workflow from even starting. The error messages are often cryptic and do not pinpoint the here-string as the root cause.\n-   **CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION:** For multi-line scripts in PowerShell, the only approved method is to define the script as a PowerShell array of strings and either join it with newlines before execution or write it to a temporary file.\n\n**Example of Correct, Approved Syntax:**\n\n```powershell\n$script = @(\n  'Line 1 of the script',\n  'Line 2 of the script',\n  '$variable = \"interpolated\"'\n)\n$script | Out-File -FilePath \"temp_script.ps1\" -Encoding utf8\npwsh -File \"temp_script.ps1\"\n```\n\nAdherence to this protocol is mandatory to ensure the basic stability and parsability of all CI/CD workflows.\n",

The main process creates the BrowserWindow and loads the static index.html. The UI shows a 'connecting' state.\n  STEP 3: Backend starts asynchronously. The main process calls the robust `startBackend()` function.\n  STEP 4: `startBackend()` spawns `fortuna-backend.exe` and starts a 30-second timeout.\n  STEP 5: The frontend UI polls for status every 3 seconds via the secure `window.electronAPI.getBackendStatus()`.\n  STEP 6: The backend `.exe` starts, its `lifespan` hook runs, and the Uvicorn server comes online within seconds.\n  STEP 7: The main process detects the \"Uvicorn running\" message (or a successful health poll) and updates its internal state to 'online'. The startup timeout is cleared.\n  STEP 8: On its next poll, the frontend receives the 'online' status.\n  STEP 9: The frontend's state changes, triggering the `fetchQualifiedRaces()` API call to `localhost:8000`.\n  STEP 10: Data is returned from the now fully-initialized backend and rendered in the UI.\n\n  FAILURE SCENARIO (Backend Crash):\n  STEP 6a: The backend `.exe` crashes on startup.\n  STEP 7a: The `on('exit')` handler in `main.js` fires. The state is set to 'error' with the exit code.\n  STEP 8a: On its next poll, the frontend receives the 'error' status and relevant logs.\n  STEP 9a: The UI renders an error message and a \"Restart Backend\" button.\n```\n\n---\n*This concludes the revised and definitive blueprint for the Fortuna Faucet application.*\n\n---\n\n### 9.

    "ROADMAP.md": "# Fortuna Faucet Roadmap\n\n## The Auditor: Real-Time Race Verification\n\nThe Auditor is a background process designed to provide real-time verification of race predictions against official results, calculating profitability and tracking performance.\n\nThe core logic is located in the [`python_service/auditor.py`](python_service/auditor.py) script.\n\n### Frontend Integration\n\nThe Auditor is designed to have its data displayed on the frontend. The `AuditorEngine` class in the script exposes two key methods for this purpose:\n\n1.  `get_rolling_metrics()`: This function is intended to power a \"Last Hour\" overlay on the UI, providing key performance indicators such as strike rate, net profit, and betting volume.\n2.  `get_recent_activity()`: This function provides a list of the most recent bet outcomes (e.g., \"CASHED\", \"BURNED\", \"PENDING\") for display in a real-time activity feed or history log.\n\nThe intended architecture is for the backend to create API endpoints (e.g., `/api/auditor/metrics`, `/api/auditor/activity`) that expose these functions. The frontend would then call these endpoints to fetch and display the data.\n\n**Note:** As of the last update, the web scraping component of the Auditor is non-functional. The description above outlines the intended design and capabilities, which are not yet fully operational.\n",
