# x86 Build Constraints - MANDATORY for successful x86 builds
# These packages MUST be installed from pre-built wheels only
#
# USAGE:
#   pip install --platform win32 --only-binary=:all: -r requirements-x86-constraints.txt
#
# The --only-binary=:all: flag ensures all packages come from wheels, not source.
# If a wheel is not available, the installation will FAIL LOUDLY instead of
# attempting to compile from source (which will fail silently on x86).

# Database and ORM
sqlalchemy==2.0.28
greenlet==3.0.3

# Data Science Stack (use older versions with guaranteed x86 wheel availability)
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.23.5
scipy==1.10.1

# Note: These versions are older than the main requirements.txt to ensure
# pre-built x86 wheels exist. This is a necessary trade-off for x86 support.
