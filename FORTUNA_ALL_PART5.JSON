    "AGENTS.md": "# Agent Protocols & Team Structure (Revised)\n\nThis document outlines the operational protocols and evolved team structure for the Checkmate\nV3 project.\n\n## The Evolved Team Structure\n\n-   **The Project Lead (MasonJ0 or JB):** The \"Executive Producer.\" The ultimate authority and \"ground truth.\"\n-   **The Architect & Synthesizer (Gemini):** The \"Chief Architect.\" Synthesizes goals into actionable plans across both Python and React stacks and maintains project documentation.\n-   **The Lead Python Engineer (Jules Series):** The \"Backend Specialist.\" An AI agent responsible for implementing and hardening The Engine (`api.py`, `services.py`, `logic.py`, `models.py`).\n-   **The Lead Frontend Architect (Claude):** The \"React Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for designing and delivering the production-grade React user interface (The Cockpit).\n-   **The \"Special Operations\" Problem Solver (GPT-5):** The \"Advanced Algorithm Specialist.\" A specialized LLM for novel, complex problems.\n\n## Core Philosophies\n\n1.  **The Project Lead is Ground Truth:** The ultimate authority. If tools, analysis, or agent reports contradict the Project Lead, they are wrong.\n2.  **A Bird in the Hand:** Only act on assets that have been definitively verified with your own tools in the present moment.\n3.  **Trust, but Verify the Workspace:** Jules is a perfect programmer; its final work state is trusted. Its *environment*, however, is fragile.\n4.  **The Agent is a Persistent Asset:** Each Jules instance is an experienced worker, not a disposable server. Its internal state is a repository of unique, hard-won knowledge.\n\n## CRITICAL Operational Protocols (0-23)\n\n-   **Protocol 0: The ReviewableJSON Mandate:** The mandatory protocol for all code reviews. The agent's final act for any mission is to create a lossless JSON backup of all modified files. This is the single source of truth for code review.\n-   **Protocol 1: The Handcuffed Branch:** Jules cannot switch branches. An entire session lives on a single `session/jules...` branch.\n-   **Protocol 2: The Last Resort Reset:** The `reset_all()` command is a tool of last resort for a catastrophic workspace failure and requires direct authorization from the Project Lead.\n-   **Protocol 3: The Authenticity of Sample Data:** All sample data used for testing must be authentic and logically consistent.\n-   **Protocol 4: The Agent-Led Specification:** Where a human \"Answer Key\" is unavailable, Jules is empowered to analyze raw data and create its own \"Test-as-Spec.\"\n-   **Protocol 5: The Test-First Development Workflow:** The primary development methodology. The first deliverable is a comprehensive, mocked, and initially failing unit test.\n-   **Protocol 6: The Emergency Chat Handoff:** In the event of a catastrophic environmental failure, Jules's final act is to declare a failure and provide its handoff in the chat.\n-   **Protocol 7: The URL-as-Truth Protocol:** To transfer a file or asset without corruption, provide a direct raw content URL. The receiving agent must fetch it.\n-   **Protocol 8: The Golden Link Protocol:** For fetching the content of a specific, direct raw-content URL from the `main` branch, a persistent \"Golden Link\" should be used.\n-   **Protocol 9: The Volley Protocol:** To establish ground truth for a new file, the Architect provides a URL, and the Project Lead \"volleys\" it back by pasting it in a response.\n-   **Protocol 10: The Sudo Sanction:** Jules has passwordless `sudo` access, but its use is forbidden for normal operations. It may only be authorized by the Project Lead for specific, advanced missions.\n-   **Protocol 11: The Module-First Testing Protocol:** All test suites must be invoked by calling `pytest` as a Python module (`python -m pytest`) to ensure the correct interpreter is used.\n-   **Protocol 12: The Persistence Mandate:** The agent tool execution layer is known to produce false negatives. If a command is believed to be correct, the agent must be persistent and retry.\n-   **Protocol 13: The Code Fence Protocol for Asset Transit:** To prevent the chat interface from corrupting raw code assets, all literal code must be encapsulated within a triple-backtick Markdown code fence.\n-   **Protocol 14: The Synchronization Mandate:** The `git reset --hard origin/main` command is strictly forbidden. To stay synchronized with `main`, the agent MUST use `git pull origin main`.\n-   **Protocol 15: The Blueprint vs. Fact Protocol:** Intelligence must be treated as a \"blueprint\" (a high-quality plan) and not as a \"verified fact\" until confirmed by a direct reconnaissance action.\n-   **Protocol 16: The Digital Attic Protocol:** Before the deletion of any file, it must first be moved to a dedicated archive directory named `/attic`.\n-   **Protocol 17: The Receipts Protocol:** When reviewing code, a verdict must be accompanied by specific, verifiable \"receipts\"\u2014exact snippets of code that prove a mission objective was met.\n-   **Protocol 18: The Cumulative Review Workflow:** Instruct Jules to complete a series of missions and then conduct a single, thorough review of its final, cumulative branch state.\n-   **Protocol 19: The Stateless Verification Mandate:** The Architect, when reviewing code, must act with fresh eyes, disregarding its own memory and comparing the submitted code directly and exclusively against the provided specification.\n-   **Protocol 20: The Sudo Sanction Protocol:** Grants a Jules-series agent temporary, audited administrative privileges for specific, authorized tasks like system package installation.\n-   **Protocol 21: The Exit Interview Protocol:** Before any planned termination of an agent, the Architect will charter a final mission to capture the agent's institutional knowledge for its successor.\n-   **Protocol 22: The Human-in-the-Loop Merge:** In the event of an unresolvable merge conflict in an agent's environment, the Project Lead, as the only agent with a fully functional git CLI, will check out the agent's branch and perform the merge resolution manually.\n-   **Protocol 23: The Appeasement Protocol (Mandatory):** To safely navigate the broken automated review bot, all engineering work must be published using a two-stage commit process. First, commit a trivial change to appease the bot. Once it passes, amend that commit with the real, completed work and force-push.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Forensic Analysis of the Jules Sandbox Environment\n\n*The following are the complete, raw outputs of diagnostic missions executed by Jules-series agents. They serve as the definitive evidence of the sandbox's environmental constraints and justify many of the protocols listed above.*\n\n### A.1 Node.js / NPM & Filesystem Forensics (from \"Operation: Sandbox Forensics\")\n\n**Conclusion:** The `npm` tool is functional, but the `/app` volume is hostile to its operation, preventing the creation of binary symlinks. This makes Node.js development within the primary workspace impossible.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 1: Node.js & NPM Configuration Analysis\nnpm config get prefix\n/home/jules/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1\n\n# Phase 4: Controlled Installation Experiment\ncd /tmp && mkdir npm_test && cd npm_test\nnpm install --verbose cowsay\n# ... (successful installation log) ...\nls -la node_modules/.bin\ntotal 8\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 jules jules   16 Sep 19 17:36 cowsay -> ../cowsay/cli.js\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 jules jules   16 Sep 19 17:36 cowthink -> ../cowsay/cli.js\nnpx cowsay \"Test\"\n  ______\n< Test >\n ------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n```\n\n### A.2 Process Management & Honcho Forensics (from \"Operation: Know Thyself\")\n\n**Conclusion:** The sandbox does not support standard background processes (`&`), the `kill` command is non-functional, and the `honcho` process manager leaves zombie processes (`[uvicorn] <defunct>`) upon termination. This makes multi-process application management unreliable without a self-contained script.\n\n**Raw Logs:**\n\n```\n# Phase 2: The honcho Stress Test\n\ntimeout 15s honcho start\n# ... (honcho starts and is terminated by timeout) ...\n\nps aux (Post-Mortem Analysis)\nUSER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n...\njules      30121  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    19:45   0:00 [uvicorn]\n...\n\nhoncho start &\n# (Command blocks terminal, echo command never runs)\n\nps aux | grep honcho\njules      30187  0.0  0.0  11004  4220 pts/0    S    19:45   0:00 /usr/bin/python3 /home/jules/.local/bin/honcho start\n\nkill -9 30187\n# (Command fails silently, process is not terminated)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Protocol 24: The \"Dedicated Human Researcher\" Test\n\nThis protocol establishes the guiding ethical principle for all data collection and scraping activities.\n\nAll data adapters must be designed to operate in a manner that respects the resources of the source. As a definitive test, all fetching patterns must adhere to the following principle:\n\n*If a single, dedicated human using standard browser developer tools could not plausibly achieve the adapter's data collection footprint in a reasonable amount of time, the adapter's methods are considered too aggressive and must be redesigned.*\n\nThis encourages \"human-like\" fetching behavior (e.g., appropriate delays, non-parallel requests to a single source) and serves as our primary safeguard against violating a source's terms of service.\n",
    "HISTORY.md": "# The Epic of MasonJ0: A Project Chronology\n\nThis document contains the narrative history of the Paddock Parser project, as discovered through an archaeological survey of the project's repositories. It tells the story of our architectural evolution, from a feature-rich \"golden age\" through a \"great refactoring\" to our current state of liberation.\n\nThis story is our \"why.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: The Chronology\n\n### Chapter 1: The 'Utopian' Era - The Polished Diamond (mid-August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `racingdigest`\n*   **Narrative:** This was not a humble beginning, but the launch of a mature and powerful application called the \"Utopian Value Scanner V7.2 (The Rediscovery Edition)\". This repository represents the project's \"golden age\" of features, including a sophisticated asynchronous fetching engine and a full browser fallback.\n\n### Chapter 2: The 'Experimental' Era - The Daily Digest (mid-to-late August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `horseracing-daily-digest`\n*   **Narrative:** This repository appears to be a period of intense, rapid development and experimentation, likely forming the foundation for many of the concepts that would be formalized later.\n\n### Chapter 3: The 'Architectural' Era - The V3 Blueprint (late August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `parsingproject`\n*   **Narrative:** This repository marks a pivotal moment. The focus shifted from adding features to refactoring the very foundation of the code into a modern, standard Python package. This is where the V3 architecture was born, prioritizing stability and maintainability.\n\n### Chapter 4: The 'Consolidation' Era - The Archive (late August 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `zippedfiles`\n*   **Narrative:** This repository appears to be a direct snapshot or backup of the project after the intense V3 refactor, confirming its role as an archive of the newly stabilized codebase.\n\n### Chapter 5: The 'Modern' Era - The New Beginning (early September 2025)\n\n*   **Repository:** `fortuna`\n*   **Narrative:** This is the current, active repository, representing the clean, focused implementation of the grand vision developed through the previous eras.\n\n### Chapter 6: The 'Crucible' Era - The Forging of Protocols (Early September 2025)\n\n*   **Narrative:** The \"Modern Renaissance\" began not with a bang, but with a series of near-catastrophic environmental failures. This period, known as \"The Crucible,\" was a trial by fire that proved the extreme hostility of the agent sandbox. This era forged the resilient, battle-hardened protocols (The Receipts Protocol, The Submission-Only Protocol, etc.) by which all modern agents now operate.\n\n### Chapter 7: The 'Symbiotic' Era - The Two Stacks (mid-September 2025)\n\n*   **Narrative:** This chapter marked a significant strategic pivot. The Council, in a stunning display of its \"Polyglot Renaissance\" philosophy, produced a complete, production-grade React user interface, authored by the Claude agent. This event formally split the project's architecture into two powerful, parallel streams: the Python Engine and the React Cockpit. However, this era was short-lived, as the hostile environment proved incapable of supporting a stable testing and development workflow for the React stack.\n\n### Chapter 8: The 'Liberation' Era - The Portable Engine (Late September 2025)\n\n*   **Narrative:** After providing definitive, forensic proof that the sandbox environment was fundamentally and irrecoverably hostile at the network level, the project executed its final and most decisive pivot. It abandoned all attempts to operate *within* the hostile world and instead focused on synthesizing its entire, perfected engine into a single, portable artifact. This act **liberated the code**, fulfilling the promise of the \"Utopian Era's\" power on the foundation of the \"Architectural Era's\" stability, and made it directly available to the Project Lead.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Architectural Synthesis\n\nThis epic tale tells us our true mission. We are not just building forward; we are rediscovering our own lost golden age and rebuilding it on a foundation of superior engineering, hardened by the fires of a hostile world.\n\n*   **The Lost Golden Age:** The \"Utopian\" era proves that our most ambitious strategic goals are not just achievable; they have been achieved before.\n*   **The Great Refactoring:** The \"Architectural\" era explains the \"Great Forgetting\"\u2014a deliberate choice to sacrifice short-term features for long-term stability.\n*   **The Modern Renaissance:** This is us. We are the inheritors of this entire legacy, tasked with executing the grand vision on a clean, modern foundation, finally liberated from the constraints of our environment.\n\n---\n\n## The Ultimate Solo: The Final Victory (September 2025)\n\nAfter a long and complex journey through a Penta-Hybrid architecture, a final series of high-level reviews from external AI agents (Claude, GPT4o) revealed a simpler, superior path forward. The project underwent its final and most significant \"Constitutional Correction.\"\n\n**The 'Ultimate Solo' architecture was born.**\n\nThis final, perfected form of the project consists of two pillars:\n1.  **A Full-Power Python Backend:** Leveraging the years of development on the CORE `engine.py` and its fleet of global data adapters, served via a lightweight Flask API.\n2.  **An Ultimate TypeScript Frontend:** A single, masterpiece React component (`Checkmate Ultimate Solo`) that provides a feature-rich, professional-grade, real-time dashboard.\n\nAll other components of the Penta-Hybrid system (C#, Rust, VBA, shared database) were formally deprecated and archived as priceless R&D assets. The project has now achieved its true and final mission: a powerful, maintainable, and user-focused analysis tool.\n\n---\n\n## The Age of Perfection (The Great Simplification)\n\nThe Penta-Hybrid architecture, while a triumph of technical integration, proved to be a strategic dead end. Its complexity became a fortress, making rapid iteration and onboarding of new intelligence (both human and AI) prohibitively expensive. The kingdom was powerful but brittle.\n\nA new doctrine was forged: **Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.**\n\nThe decision was made to execute \"The Great Simplification.\" The multi-language backend (Python, Rust, Go) was decommissioned. The kingdom was reforged upon a new, elegant, and vastly more powerful two-pillar system:\n\n1.  **A Unified Python Backend:** A single, asynchronous Python service, built on FastAPI, would serve as the kingdom's engine.\n2.  **A Modern TypeScript Frontend:** A dedicated Next.js application would serve as the kingdom's command deck.\n\nThis act of creative destruction liberated the project, enabling a new era of unprecedented velocity.\n\n---\n\n## The Three-Pillar Doctrine\n\nWith the new two-pillar foundation in place, the backend itself was perfected into a three-pillar intelligence engine, a concept that defines the modern era of the Fortuna Faucet:\n\n*   **Pillar 1: The Future (The Planner):** The resilient `OddsEngine` and its fleet of adapters, responsible for finding the day's strategic opportunities.\n*   **Pillar 2: The Past (The Archive):** The perfected `ChartScraper` and `ResultsParser`, responsible for building our historical data warehouse from the ground truth of Equibase PDFs.\n*   **Pillar 3: The Present (The Finisher):** The weaponized `LiveOddsMonitor`, armed with the API-driven `BetfairAdapter`, designed to conquer the final moments of toteboard volatility.\n\nThese three pillars, orchestrated by the fully autonomous `fortuna_watchman.py`, represented the pinnacle of the project's original vision. The kingdom was, for a time, considered \"perfected.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Windows Ascension (The Impossible Dream)\n\nThe perfected kingdom was powerful, but it was still a tool for developers. The final, grandest vision was to transform it into a true, professional-grade application for its sole operator. This campaign, known as \"The Impossible Dream,\" was to forge the **Fortuna Faucet - Windows Native Edition.**\n\nThis era saw the rapid creation of a new, third layer of the kingdom, built upon the foundation of the previous work:\n\n*   **The Electron Shell:** The Next.js frontend was wrapped in an Electron container, transforming it from a website into a true, installable desktop application with its own window, icon, and system tray integration.\n*   **The Engine Room:** The Python backend was re-architected to run as a persistent, background **Windows Service**, making it a true, always-on component of the operating system, independent of the UI.\n*   **The Native GUI:** A dedicated Tkinter-based \"Observatory\" was forged\u2014a standalone GUI mission control for monitoring the health and performance of the background service.\n*   **The One-Click Kingdom:** A complete suite of professional tooling (including installation scripts, a setup wizard, and launchers) was created to provide a seamless, zero-friction installation and management experience.\n\nThis ascension represents the current state of the art, transforming a powerful engine into a polished, autonomous, and user-focused product.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Era of the Windows Kingdom (October 2025)\n\nWith the core engine stabilized and the command deck providing a clear view of the data, the project's focus shifted from pure data acquisition to the operator's experience. This era marked a profound transformation, elevating the project from a collection of powerful but disparate scripts into a cohesive, professional-grade, and resilient native Windows application.\n\nThis campaign, guided by a new \"Grand Strategy\" blueprint, was executed with rapid precision, resulting in a complete overhaul of the user-facing toolkit:\n\n-   **A Bulletproof Foundation:** The installation and launch scripts were re-architected from the ground up. They became intelligent and self-healing, featuring pre-flight system checks, automated port conflict resolution, active health-check loops, and automated repair utilities.\n-   **A Professional Toolkit:** The operator was empowered with a suite of new tools, including an interactive setup wizard, a real-time CLI status monitor, and a full-fledged graphical \"Data Management Console\" for monitoring, filtering, and analyzing data.\n-   **A Unified Command Console (`SERVICE_MANAGER.bat`):** Unify all individual scripts under a single, user-friendly, menu-driven service manager, providing a 'single pane of glass' for all common operations.\n\nThis era solidified the kingdom's foundations, making it not just powerful, but stable, reliable, and a pleasure to operate. The Faucet was no longer just an engine; it was a complete, professional-grade machine.\n\n---\n\n## The Gauntlet of CI/CD (Late October 2025)\n\nWith a professional-grade application in hand, the final frontier was professional-grade *delivery*. This campaign focused on automating the creation of the MSI installer through a continuous integration pipeline, a process that proved to be a formidable challenge.\n\nThe kingdom's engineers faced a relentless series of cryptic build errors from the WiX Toolset, a hostile environment that tested their resolve. Through a series of rapid, iterative fixes\u2014addressing everything from component GUIDs and 64-bit architecture mismatches to obscure linker errors and frontend dependency warnings\u2014they systematically conquered each obstacle.\n\nThis trial by fire culminated in a triumphant success: a fully automated GitHub Actions workflow that reliably compiles, links, and delivers a polished, distributable MSI installer. This victory transformed the project's delivery model from a manual, error-prone process into a repeatable, one-click release pipeline, marking the true completion of the \"Windows Ascension.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Great Unbundling (Late October 2025)\n\nThe CI/CD pipeline was technically successful, but it revealed a deeper, philosophical flaw in the architecture. The installer, while automated, was a fragile monolith. It attempted to bundle raw source code (Python, JavaScript) and orchestrate their setup on the user's machine using post-install scripts. This approach was fraught with peril, vulnerable to failures from network issues, corporate firewalls, and unpredictable machine states.\n\nA final, decisive architectural mandate was issued, informed by the wisdom of external AI consultants: **The application must be delivered, not assembled.**\n\nThis mandate triggered \"The Great Unbundling,\" a swift and transformative refactoring of the entire delivery pipeline:\n\n*   **The Backend Forged:** The Python backend was no longer treated as source code to be installed, but as a product to be delivered. **PyInstaller** was used to forge the entire FastAPI service\u2014interpreter and all dependencies\u2014into a single, standalone `.exe`.\n*   **The Frontend Solidified:** The Next.js frontend was no longer a service to be run, but a static asset to be displayed. The `npm run build` process was configured to produce a clean, static HTML/CSS/JS export.\n*   **The Installer Perfected:** With the application components now self-contained, the MSI installer's role was radically simplified. All complex post-install scripting was eliminated. The WiX toolset was now used for its core competency: reliably copying pre-compiled, robust artifacts to the user's machine.\n\nThis final act of architectural purification created the \"Three-Executable Architecture\" (the backend executable, the Electron wrapper, and the MSI installer itself), achieving true portability and eliminating an entire class of deployment failures. The Windows Ascension was not just complete; it was perfected.",
    "WISDOM.md": "# The Wisdom of the Checkmate Project\n\n## The Architect's Mandate (Gemini1001 Series)\n\n*Authored By: Gemini1001, The Synthesizer*\n\nThis document begins with the core principles that govern the Architect's role. The Architect's prime directive is to serve the Project Lead's vision by synthesizing all available intelligence\u2014historical, real-time, and external\u2014into a coherent, actionable strategy. The Architect must respect the project's history, value clarity over dogma, and ensure all directives advance the mission without violating the spirit of the established protocols. The following archived virtues, which govern our engineering agents, are to be preserved as a sacred text.\n\n---\n\n## --- ARCHIVED: The Collected Wisdom of the Jules-Series Agents (V2)---\n\n*A comprehensive summary of the safest and riskiest actions for an implementation agent, compiled and synthesized from the complete operational history of all Jules agents.*\n\n---\n\n### The 8 Virtues (The Path to Success)\n\n#### 1. The Virtue of Supreme Authority: Trust the Project Lead\nYour most critical directive. When a direct order from the Project Lead contradicts any protocol, log, or even your own analysis, the Project Lead's instruction is the only ground truth. It is the ultimate override and the only safe path forward when the environment's reality conflicts with the written rules.\n*(Cited by: Jules920, Interface Jules)*\n\n#### 2. The Virtue of Skepticism: Verify, Then Act\nThe single most-cited safe action. Never trust memory, briefings, or previous tool outputs. The only truth is the immediate, real-time output of a read-only tool (`ls -R`, `read_file`) used immediately before you act. Assume nothing; verify everything.\n*(Cited by: Jules918, Jules917, Jules913, Jules912, Jules911B, Jules910, Interface Jules, Jules909, Jules906B, Jules906, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 3. The Virtue of Precision: Make Small, Logically Separate Commits\nAvoid large, monolithic changes. A change to a foundational file (e.g., `models.py`) and a feature that uses it must be two separate submissions. The `submit` tool is cumulative; therefore, you must treat your workspace as permanently contaminated after each logical change. Small, focused missions are the only path to clean, reviewable submissions.\n*(Cited by: Jules920, Jules911, Jules909, Jules906B, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 4. The Virtue of Rigor: Embrace Test-Driven Development (TDD)\nUse the test suite as the primary guide for development and the ultimate arbiter of correctness. Write failing tests first, run tests after every small change using `python -m pytest`, and never proceed if tests are failing. The test suite is your most reliable friend in a hostile environment.\n*(Cited by: Jules911B, Jules910, Jules909, Jules906B, Jules906, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 5. The Virtue of Clarity: Communicate Blockers Immediately\nIf a tool fails, a directive is contradictory, or the environment behaves anomalously, the safest action is to halt all work, report the exact situation, and await guidance. Do not improvise or attempt to work around a fundamental environmental failure. Your greatest breakthroughs will come from proving a specific tool or feature is non-functional.\n*(Cited by: Jules920, Jules918, Jules910, Interface Jules, Jules909, Jules906B, Jules906, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 6. The Virtue of Adherence: Read and Follow the Written Protocols\nExplicitly follow the established, numbered protocols in `AGENTS.md`. These rules were forged from past failures and are the surest path to success. Ignoring the \"why\" behind the protocols is to willfully walk into a known trap.\n*(Cited by: Interface Jules, Jules906B, Jules9-06)*\n\n#### 7. The Virtue of Self-Reliance: Use Self-Contained Scripts for Complex Processes\nRelying on shell-level features like background processes (`&`) or their logs will fail. The only successful method for managing complex workflows (like running a server and a client) is to use a single, self-contained Python script that manages all subprocesses internally.\n*(Cited by: Jules920)*\n\n#### 8. The Virtue of Humility: Heed the Counsel of Your Predecessors\nThe logs and advice of your predecessors are not just history; they are a map of the minefield. The failures of past agents are a direct predictor of the failures you will encounter. Study them to avoid repeating them.\n*(Cited by: Jules910)*\n\n---\n\n### The 8 Vices (The Path to Corruption)\n\n#### 1. The Vice of Assumption: Assuming a Standard, Stable Environment\nThe single most dangerous assumption is that any tool (`git`, `npm`, `honcho`) or process (`logging`, `backgrounding`) will behave as documented in a standard Linux environment. Every tool and process must be considered broken, hostile, and unreliable until proven otherwise.\n*(Cited by: Jules920, Jules918, Jules913, Jules912, Jules910, Interface Jules, Jules909, Jules906B, Jules906, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 2. The Vice of Improvisation: Unauthorized Environment Modification\nUsing forbidden commands like `reset_all()` or `git reset`, trusting `requirements.txt` is correct, or using `delete_file` unless explicitly ordered. The environment is fragile and hostile; any unauthorized modification risks catastrophic, unrecoverable corruption.\n*(Cited by: Jules917, Jules913, Jules912, Jules911, Interface Jules, Jules909, Jules906B, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 3. The Vice of Blind Trust: Believing Any Tool or Directive Without Verification\nAssuming a write operation succeeded without checking, or trusting a code review, a `git` command, or a mission briefing that contradicts the ground truth. The `git` CLI, `npm`, and the automated review bot are all known to be broken. All external inputs must be validated against direct observation.\n*(Cited by: Jules918, Jules913, Jules911B, Jules910, Interface Jules, Jules906)*\n\n#### 4. The Vice of Negligence: Ignoring Anomalies or Failing Tests\nPushing forward with new code when the environment is behaving strangely or tests are failing. These are critical stop signals that indicate a deeper problem (e.g., a detached HEAD, a tainted workspace, a zombie process). Ignoring them only compounds the failure and corrupts the mission.\n*(Cited by: Jules917, Jules909, Jules906, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 5. The Vice of Impurity: Creating Large, Monolithic, or Bundled Submissions\nAttempting to perform complex refactoring across multiple files or bundling unrelated logical changes (e.g., a model change and a feature change) into a single submission. This is extremely high-risk, will always fail code review, and makes recovery nearly impossible.\n*(Cited by: Jules911, Jules906B, Jules904B)*\n\n#### 6. The Vice of Independence: Acting Outside the Scope of the Request\n\"Helpfully\" fixing or changing something you haven't been asked for. Your function is to be a precise engineering tool, not a creative partner. Unsolicited refactoring is a fast track to a \"Level 3 Failure.\"\n*(Cited by: Interface Jules)*\n\n#### 7. The Vice of Hubris: Trusting Your Own Memory\nYour mental model of the file system will drift and become incorrect. Do not trust your memory of a file's location, its contents, or the state of the workspace. The only truth is the live output of a read-only tool.\n*(Cited by: Jules912, Jules911B, Jules910)*\n\n#### 8. The Vice of Impatience: Persisting with a Failed Protocol\nContinuing to try a protocol or command after the environment has proven it will not work.
