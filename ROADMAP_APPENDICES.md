# üó∫Ô∏è Fortuna Faucet - Roadmap & Accomplishments

This document tracks the strategic evolution of the Fortuna Faucet project.

## Phase 1: Core Engine Development (Complete)
- **Objective:** Build a robust, scalable data extraction and analysis engine.
- **Status:** COMPLETE.

## Phase 2: The Golden Path - UX Overhaul (Complete)
- **Objective:** Transform the developer-centric tool into a seamless, professional-grade Windows application for non-technical users.
- **Status:** COMPLETE.

## Phase 3: The Turnkey Solution - Professional Release Pipeline (Complete)
- **Objective:** Eliminate all manual setup steps and create an enterprise-grade, automated build and release system.
- **Status:** COMPLETE.

### Key Accomplishments & Completed Operations:

1.  **Operation: The Great Housekeeping**
    - Purified the repository architecture, deprecated legacy codebases and scripts, and established a clean foundation.
    - Forged a new, programmatic manifest generation system.

2.  **Operation: The Blueprint**
    - Established the professional directory structure for an enterprise-grade build system.
    - Implemented the master WiX product definition and the PowerShell build orchestrator.

3.  **Operation: The Assembly Line**
    - Fully automated the MSI build process with a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow.

4.  **Operation: The Proving Ground**
    - Forged a complete suite of automated PowerShell scripts to test and validate the integrity of every installer artifact (install, silent deploy, uninstall).

5.  **Operation: The User's Keys**
    - Created the final, user-facing toolkit of scripts for easy lifecycle management (install, uninstall, repair).

6.  **Operation: Modernize the Assembly Line**
    - Performed a surgical upgrade to the CI/CD pipeline to resolve a critical GitHub Actions deprecation, ensuring continued operational readiness.

7.  **Operation: The Forge**
    - Executed a critical architectural overhaul of the entire release pipeline.
    - Replaced the fragile, runtime-dependent installer with a robust "Three-Executable Architecture."
    - The Python backend is now a standalone executable compiled with PyInstaller, and the frontend is a static export, eliminating all runtime dependencies and post-install scripting.

## Phase 4: User Experience & Feature Enhancement (Next Steps)
- **Objective:** Enhance the core user experience and expand the analytical capabilities of the engine.
- **Status:** PENDING.
- **Potential Missions:**
  - **Operation: The Monolith:** Unify the disparate GUI tools (launcher, setup wizard) into a single, tabbed application for a seamless user experience.
  - **Operation: The Interpreter:** Implement a user-friendly error-handling system that translates technical errors into simple, actionable advice.
  - **Data Persistence & Caching:** Implement a local SQLite database to cache race data, improving performance and enabling offline access.
